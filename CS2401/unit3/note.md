## Reading Assignment

- Marsic, I. (2012). Software engineering. Rutgers Unversity.<https://www.ece.rutgers.edu/~marsic/books/SE/book-SE_marsic.pdf>
  - Read Chapter 2, Section 2.4 Use Case Modeling.
    - ユースケースは、ユーザがビジネスを達成するために計画したシステムをどのように利用するか記述したもの
      - A use case is a description of how a user will use the planned system to accomplish business goals.
    - 詳細化すると、アクターとシステムとの利用シナリオのこと
  - Read Chapter 4, section 4.2.1 Use case Points
- Ambler, S. (2003-2018). UML 2 Use Case Diagrams: An Agile Introduction. Agile Modeling. <http://www.agilemodeling.com/artifacts/useCaseDiagram.htm>

## Discussion Forum

What is the difference between a scenario and a use case? When do you use each construct? Explain with the help of 1-2 suitable examples.

## Programming Assignment

NOTE:  It is easy to copy the answer from internet and amend it to your need and submit , in order to get good grades, but it will not help you learn and understand the topic better. Please try to be honest with your submissions to these programming assignments as they will help you hone your skills and understanding of the respective topic , which you will be taking along in the real world after the end of the course. Scoring should be based on learning, not copying and pasting.

You are hired to develop a software system for motion detection and garage door control. The system should turn the garage door lights on automatically when it detects motion within a given perimeter. The garage door opener should be possible to control either by a remote radio transmitter or by a manual button switch. The opener should include the following safety feature. An “electric eye” sensor, which projects invisible infrared light beams, should be used to detect if someone or something passes under the garage door while it closes. If the beam is obstructed while the door is going down, the door should not close—the system should automatically stop and reverse the door movement.

The relevant hardware parts of the system are as follows (see Figure):

motion detector
external light bulb
motor for moving the garage door
“electric eye” sensor
remote control radio transmitter and receiver
manual opener button switch
Assume that all the hardware components are available and you only need to develop a software system that controls the hardware components.

Identify the actors for the system and their goals
Derive only the use cases relevant to the system objective and write brief or casual text description of each
Draw the use case diagram for the system
For the use case that deals with the remote-controlled garage door opening, write a fully dressed description
Draw the system sequence diagram(s) for the use case selected in (d)
Show the operation contracts for the operations of the use case selected in (d)
