Two possible messages are required at an auction:
Notify sellers of new bids.
Notify the buyer of the status of the auction in which he/she has placed a bid.
Thus, according to Marsic, the premise of the publisher is explained as follows (Marsic, 2012)
Knows event source(s)
Knows interested obj’s (subscribers) Doing Responsibilities:
Registers/Unregisters subscribers • Notifies the subscribers of events

The above conditions describe two classes that implement the publisher interface and the subscriber interface

ItemInfo(Publisher)→BuyerInfo(Subscriber)
When the isReserved flag of the ItemInfo class becomes true, a message is issued to the subscriber. The message is received by the BuyerInfo class, which confirms that the seller has received a new bid.
BidsList(Publisher)->SellerInfo(Subscriber)
The BidsList class emits a message when a new Bid object is added to the list. The SellerInfo class receives the issued message and notifies the buyer of the product of the auction status information.

The current implementation does not support changes to the product description or time period, but this interface implementation will be able to handle such additional functions without problems.
