As I found the areas of reengineering and software documentation to be particularly important as topics of study in this week's unit, I will explain my understanding of these areas.

1. reengineering
The most important aspect of software reengineering is to reimplement a working system in a more maintainable form. This can be due to a wide variety of factors, such as maintenance deadlines of the products in use, lack of language experts, and OS upgrades. I have participated in a project to migrate a system running a COBOL application on UNIX to a Linux architecture. The response was very severe. Through my own experience and learning, I believe that the important points for reengineering are not only to perform the reengineering as automatically as possible but also to clarify what kind of testing process to go through and how to respond when a problem occurs. 2.
2. software documentation
There are two main types of software documentation: process documentation and product documentation. Both of these documents are essential to the project, but the important point is how to maintain the documents that contain the necessary information without making them obsolete. It is common for documentation to become an afterthought as people focus too much on the program, resulting in documentation that is out of touch with the actual situation. To prevent these situations, it is important to know how much documentation to maintain as a project and by what process.
This is the last week of the CS2401 course, and only graded tests remain. I will use this week to review the units so far and hope to get the best results.
