In response to this question, I have considered the possible defects.

A. Recognizing equilateral triangles as isosceles triangles
B. Triangles that do not satisfy the conditions for being triangles are judged as triangles.
C. Incorrect values are entered.

Then, we created a test case

Cases in which triangles are valid

1. (3,5,6): The scalene triangle is valid.
2. (3,4,5): The scalene triangles that are edge cases are formed.
3. (5,5,7): The isosceles triangle is formed.
4. (5,5,5): An equilateral triangle is formed.

Cases where no triangle is formed

5. (3,0,6): 0 is given on input.
6. (-1,4,5): Negative numbers are given on input.
7. (1,2,4): All values are integers but no triangle is formed.
