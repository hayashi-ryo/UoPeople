In this week's unit, I mainly learned about test design methods. I will summarize my understanding of the design method for conducting unit testing, as I believe it will be helpful in many situations where it will live on at work.
First of all, when testing, the entire system is not tested immediately but is divided into its components. This approach is the exact opposite of the process when implementing a system. (In the case of implementation, the project progresses in detail from the system outline to the detailed parts.
Also, the purpose of testing is to find defects (Marsic, 2012), but in my experience, more than 90% of test cases fail to detect defects. This does not mean that the test cases are bad, but rather that the sections that occur in the test cases are implementation-critical and are implemented to take care of them as the program is implemented. I could feel that the test case design method that I learned this time is not only for test case implementation but also for the design of the program.
