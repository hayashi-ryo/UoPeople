## Discussion Forum

- From your point of view, describe the strengths and weaknesses of users during the requirements elicitation activity. Describe also the strengths and weaknesses of developers during the requirements elicitation activity.

## Written Assignment

Consider the following nonfunctional requirements and determine which of them can be verified and which cannot. Write acceptance tests for each requirement or explain why it is not testable.

“The user interface must be user-friendly and easy to use.”
“The number of mouse clicks the user needs to perform when navigating to any window of the system’s user interface must be less than 10.”
“The user interface of the new system must be simple enough so that any user can use it with a minimum training.”
“The maximum latency from the moment the user clicks a hyperlink in a web page until the rendering of the new web page starts is 1 second over a broadband connection.”
“In case of failure, the system must be easy to recover and must suffer minimum loss of important data.”
