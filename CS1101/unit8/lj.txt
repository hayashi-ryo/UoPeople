Prepare an input file (lj_input.txt) with two elements added to the dictionary submitted in the unit7 Learning Journal.

The implementation of the program for outputting this inverted dictionary is defined as follows
  Reading the input file(read_dicFile function)
    Since all elements of the dictionary file are strings, format the file as a string and output it.
    Delete unnecessary characters when formatting
  Writing to output file(write_dicFile function)
    Format and write the file in the format of key : value-list

Submit the program (lj.py) and its output (lj_output.txt) based on these designs.
