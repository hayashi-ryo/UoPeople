argument

The correct answer is: A statement that creates a new variable and gives it a value. → assignment statement, Information in a program that is meant for other programmers (or anyone reading the source code) and has no effect on the execution of the program. → comment, The ability to combine simple expressions and statements into compound statements and expressions in order to represent complex computations concisely. → composition, To join two operands end-to-end. → concatenate, What the Python interpreter does to an expression to find its value. → evaluate, A combination of variables, operators, and values that represents a single result value. → expression, A Python data type that stores floating-point numbers. → float, A Python data type that holds positive and negative whole numbers. → int, A reserved word that is used by the interpreter to parse programs. → keyword, One of the values on which an operator operates. → operand, A special symbol that represents a simple computation like addition, multiplication, or string concatenation. → operator, A unit of code that the Python interpreter can execute. → statement, A Python data type that holds a string of characters. → str, A number or letter that can be stored in a variable or evaluated in an expression. → value, A name that refers to a value. → variable

False

The * operator also works on strings for which it performs repetition.
True

In Python, the ‘+’ operator can be used with numbers and with strings. What is a property that number addition has, but string concatenation does not?
expression value does not depend on the order of numeric addition operands

Programmers generally choose names for their variables that are meaningful and document what the variable is used for.
True

A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
True

As programs get bigger and more complicated, they get more difficult to read. This is one reason why programmers should use comments in their code.
True

In a script, an expression all by itself is a legal statement, but it does not do anything.
True

In Python, the expression “a ** (b ** c)” is the same as “(a ** b)
False

Using Python keywords for variable names will result in a ________________
syntax error

A script usually contains a sequence of statements. If there is more than one statement, the results appear one at a time as the statements execute.
True

The acronym PEMDAS is a way to remember the order of operations in Python.
True

When a Python function is called, inside the function, the arguments are assigned to variables called parameters.
True

Python functions may or may not take arguments and may or may not return a result.
True

An expression is a combination of values, variables, and operators. If you type an expression on the command line, the interpreter evaluates it and displays the result.
True
