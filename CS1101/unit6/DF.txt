Describe the difference between objects and values using the terms “equivalent” and “identical”. Illustrate the difference using your examples with Python lists and the “is” operator.

Thinking of two lists.
a = [100,200,300]
b = [100,200,300]
The results of the are and == operations on these two lists would be output.
a == b: True
a is b: False
This indicates that the values each list has are themselves equivalent, but not identical. The elements are the same, so at first glance identical a and b appear to be identical, but in reality, they are different things!

Describe the relationship between objects, references, and aliasing. Again, create your examples with Python lists.

Again, create a new list and variables. 
  c = [100, 200, 300]
  d = c
The association of an object, such as a list, with a variable, as in this example, is called a reference. The object itself also has multiple names: variable c and variable d. These are called aliasing.
Also, changing the alias itself changes all variables that refer to it.
Output
  d: [100, 200, 300]
  c[1] = 300
  d: [100, 300, 300]

Finally, create your example of a function that modifies a list passed in as an argument. Describe what your function does in terms of arguments, parameters, objects, and references.

Created a function that appends a string to the end of the function and removes the string with index 0

def FIFO(lst, a):
  lst.append(a)
  lst.pop(0)

This function uses the list object and string given as arguments to modify the object alias itself. The execution is described below.

script
  e = ["basketball", "baseball", "soccer"]
  print(e)
  FIFO(e, "tennis")
  print(e)

Output
  ['basketball', 'baseball', 'soccer']
  ['baseball', 'soccer', 'tennis']
