Hello classmates, I would like to explain my views on this topic.
The MVC model, which is the theme of this presentation, is a concept to achieve a loosely coupled nature, which is an element required for good software, and to clarify the scope of responsibility and influence of multiple programmers. According to the text, it is described as followsï¼š

When the MVC pattern is applied to a component, the model consists of the data that represents the current state of the component. The view is simply the visual presentation of the component on the screen. And the controller is the aspect of the component that carries out actions in response to events generated by the user (or by other sources such as timers). The idea is to assign responsibility for the model, the view, and the controller to different objects. (Eck, D. J. 2022)

Using a JavaFX implementation as an example, a request to a program by a user operation is processed as follows.

1. A user action such as a button press occurs
2. The controller determines what business logic to execute and calls Model
3. The Model performs the processing and returns the result to the Controller
4. Controller passes the returned results to the View for display on the screen
5. Display on-screen by View

In this way, user actions can be divided into business logic, visual resources on the screen, and concrete actions generated by the user. I had already put this idea into practice in our Lab10 assignment in unit 6.
DrawTextPanel.java is responsible for controlling the View that is displayed to the user and the events generated by user actions. The following code is exactly the part that does the controlling.

```java
private void doMenuCommand(String command) {
  if (command.equals("Save...")) { // save all the string info to a file
   SimpleFileChooser fileChooser = new SimpleFileChooser();
   File outputFile = fileChooser.getOutputFile();
   try {
   PrintWriter p = new PrintWriter (new FileWriter(outputFile));
   Color background = canvas.getBackground();//backgroung in the first line
   p.println(background.getRGB());
    for (DrawTextItem s: theString){
     p.println(s.getString()); //the text 
     p.println(s.getX());//x-coordinate of text
     p.println(s.getY());//y-coordinate of text
     Color textcolor = s.getTextColor();
     p.println(textcolor.getRGB());//color of the text
    }
   p.close();// close the print writer
   }
   catch (Exception e) {
    //show error in a messagebox
    JOptionPane.showMessageDialog(this, "Error while saving file!!\n" +e);
   }
  }
} 
```

DrawTextItem.java is also responsible for designing the component that the user will manipulate and generating instances of its state. In the previous unit, the new process could be implemented with a minimum amount of modification because the program had already been implemented, which is divided according to the MVC concept.
