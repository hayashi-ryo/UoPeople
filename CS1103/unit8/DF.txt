  If you want to change the UI for each OS of the terminal where the user logs in (e.g., Windows and iOS), you can unify the impression of the GUI for each usage environment by adding a process to acquire user login information and a process to change the display according to the results.
Using this method, it is not only possible to unify the impression of the GUI, but also to design a more user-friendly GUI that takes into account what exists or does not exist in each user environment.
