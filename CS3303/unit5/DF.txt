Hello, classmate. I will explain my understanding of the theme this time.
Introduction

In this task, we are required to execute the binary search tree (BST) algorithm in the Jeliot environment and understand its operation. The provided Java program inserts five nodes into a binary search tree and then traverses the tree. By visualizing the tree structure and observing the insertion and traversal operations, it is possible to deepen our understanding of the tree algorithm.
Running the program in Jeliot is a crucial step to verify how the tree structure and traversal algorithms function. In this task, we will examine the steps for insertion and traversal of the algorithm, and then perform asymptotic analysis to determine the computational complexity of the algorithm. Furthermore, we will discuss the type of tree generated by the algorithm and the traversal method used.


Explanation of the Algorithm

The provided Java program defines the basic structure of the tree through the `Node` class. This class contains two child nodes (`left` and `right`) and an integer `value`. Each node is designed to insert new values into either the left or right child node.
The core of the program consists of node insertion and tree traversal. In the `main` method, the root node is created with the value 5, and the `insert` method is used to insert five values (1, 8, 6, 3, 9) into the tree. This insertion process follows the rules of the binary search tree (BST), where a node is inserted to the left if its value is smaller than the current node's value, or to the right if it is larger.
After the nodes are inserted, the `printOrder` method is used to traverse the entire tree. This method uses recursion, visiting the left child node first, then printing the value of the current node, and finally visiting the right child node. Traversing the tree in this order allows the values in the tree to be displayed in ascending order.
The entire algorithm consists of a simple yet effective process of constructing the tree and then verifying its structure through traversal.

Tree Structure and Traversal
The provided program constructs a binary search tree (BST). In this tree structure, each node has at most two child nodes, and the rule is that the left child node contains a value smaller than the parent node, while the right child node contains a value larger than the parent node. This ensures that each node in the tree maintains a sorted order throughout its descendants.
The program first creates a tree with the root value of 5, and then the values 1, 8, 6, 3, and 9 are inserted in order. This results in the following tree structure:

FIGURE

After inserting the values, the `printOrder` method is used to traverse the tree. This algorithm uses in-order traversal, where the left child node is visited first, followed by the parent node, and finally the right child node. In-order traversal is a common method for outputting values in ascending order in a binary search tree.
With in-order traversal in this program, the node values are output in the following order: 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9. This confirms that the tree has been properly constructed and traversed.



Asymptotic Analysis

1. Node Insertion

Big O (Worst Case)
In the worst-case scenario for node insertion, the tree may become skewed to one side. For example, if the inserted values are always larger or smaller, the tree will form a linear structure. In this case, the insertion will pass through all nodes, resulting in a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

Big Omega (Best Case)
In the best-case scenario, the tree is perfectly balanced, and the insertion operation depends on the height of the tree. In this case, the height of the tree is proportional to `log n`, and the time complexity for the best-case insertion is Ω(log n).

Big Theta (Average Case)
In the average case, the tree is partially balanced, and the insertion operation is based on the height of the tree. Thus, the time complexity is Θ(log n). This complexity represents the expected value when the tree is not perfectly balanced but also not extremely skewed.

2. Tree Traversal

Big O (Worst Case)
The `printOrder` method performs an in-order traversal, visiting all nodes in the tree exactly once. Regardless of the tree's structure, the worst-case time complexity for traversal is O(n).

Big Omega (Best Case)
Even in the best case, all nodes must be visited, so the time complexity is Ω(n). This means that the time required for traversal always depends on the number of nodes.

Big Theta (Average Case)
Due to the nature of in-order traversal, every node is visited once, so the average-case time complexity for traversal is Θ(n). Regardless of how the tree is structured, the entire tree must be traversed.

Summary

The time complexity for the node insertion operation varies depending on the balance of the tree. In the worst case, the complexity is O(n), in the best case it is Ω(log n), and in the average case it is Θ(log n). On the other hand, the tree traversal operation always depends on the total number of nodes, so the complexity for Big O, Big Omega, and Big Theta is O(n), Ω(n), Θ(n) respectively.
As such, the balance of the tree has a significant impact on the efficiency of the algorithm. To perform efficient operations, it is ideal for the tree to remain as balanced as possible.



Conclusion

Through this task, we confirmed the operation of the algorithm for constructing and traversing a binary search tree (BST) using the Jeliot environment, and subsequently performed asymptotic analysis on the insertion and traversal operations. It was confirmed that the balance of the tree greatly affects the algorithm's performance, with the best-case time complexity being O(log n) and the worst-case being O(n) for insertion. In contrast, the in-order traversal of the entire tree consistently has a time complexity of O(n), as every node must be visited.
This algorithm analysis deepened our understanding of the characteristics of binary search trees and how they influence the performance of algorithms. Additionally, by conducting asymptotic analysis, we learned how to evaluate the efficiency of algorithms and identify points for improvement.
