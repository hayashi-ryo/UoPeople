Summary of the Week
This week, I enhanced my understanding of binary trees and focused extensively on tree traversal techniques and practical implementation. I delved into the properties, notations, and structure of binary trees, gaining a clear understanding of the complete binary tree theory and its extensions. Additionally, I explored the Huffman coding tree, a data compression technique that was new to me. In practice, I implemented various tree traversal methods, including pre-order, post-order, and in-order traversal, which helped solidify my grasp of the subject. Furthermore, I worked on binary search trees, learning not only how to construct them but also how to use them in priority queues and heaps.

Personal Reflections
Implementing binary tree algorithms for the first time gave me a deeper appreciation of how crucial memory management and computational complexity are in software development. For example, in binary search trees, the efficiency of searching and inserting nodes greatly depends on how well the tree is balanced, which can affect the overall performance of an application. This made me think more critically about the trade-offs between time complexity (like O(log n) for BST searches) and the memory space required to maintain an efficient tree structure.
The experience also highlighted the importance of space complexity, especially when dealing with larger datasets. For instance, when implementing Huffman coding trees, I became much more aware of how frequent data patterns can be exploited to minimize memory usage. Although I was somewhat familiar with Huffman coding from a theoretical standpoint, the process of actually building the tree and seeing how it could compress data based on frequency was a revelation. This understanding will be invaluable for future projects that involve data compression or any task requiring optimization of space.
Furthermore, using Java for these implementations presented some challenges. Having not used Java extensively in recent months, I found myself initially struggling with syntax and recalling specific methods, but this provided a great opportunity to refresh my skills. It was also a reminder of how important it is to stay up to date with programming languages I might not use regularly, as proficiency can fade over time.

Topics Studied in Depth
One of the key takeaways this week was how visualization tools like Jeliot can bridge the gap between theory and practice. I used Jeliot to visualize the execution of the algorithms I implemented, particularly the traversal algorithms and binary search tree operations. Watching the animations of the binary trees being traversed in real-time helped me better understand the flow of the algorithm and the specific operations taking place at each step. This visualization also gave me more confidence in my ability to debug and refine my code, as I could see the exact point where issues arose.
Additionally, learning about array-based and pointer-based implementations of binary trees deepened my understanding of the memory overhead and efficiency trade-offs involved in maintaining these structures. For example, while array-based implementations are straightforward, they can be less flexible than pointer-based implementations, which allow dynamic growth but require careful management of memory allocation and deallocation. Understanding these differences is crucial when choosing the right data structure for a particular problem.

Future Challenges and Goals for Next Week
This weekâ€™s assignments allowed me to develop a solid foundation in binary tree concepts, but I realize that there is still much to learn, especially when applying these concepts to more complex data structures and algorithms. One challenge I faced was efficiently managing binary search trees in terms of both time complexity and memory usage. I plan to dedicate more time to mastering these aspects by tackling advanced problems that involve optimizing binary trees. My goal for next week is to focus on these advanced tree structures, as well as to work on optimizing search algorithms, thereby improving my overall coding efficiency and problem-solving skills.
