Reflect on the concept of polynomial and rational functions. What concepts (only the names) did you need to accommodate these concepts in your mind?

To understand polynomial and rational functions, we need to know about the most basic concept, power function. According to the text, power function is of the form f(x)=kx^p(where k and p are real numbers, and k is known as the coefficient. This form is the most basic concept of all functions, and polynomial and rational functions are expressed in terms of combinations of these power functions.
The polynomial function is defined by the addition of multiple power funcition and is generally expressed as follows
𝑓(𝑥)=𝑎𝑛𝑥𝑛+... +𝑎2𝑥2+𝑎1𝑥+𝑎0
This is called the general form of a polynomial function. Each 𝑎𝑖 is a coefficient and can be any real number, but 𝑎𝑛≠. Each expression 𝑎𝑖𝑥𝑖 is a term of a polynomial function.(Abramson, 2017)
Next, a RATIONAL FUNCTION is typically expressed as follows.
 𝑓(𝑥)=𝑃(𝑥)𝑄(𝑥)=𝑎𝑝𝑥𝑝+𝑎𝑝-1𝑥𝑝-1+...  +𝑎1𝑥+𝑎0𝑏𝑞𝑥𝑞+𝑏𝑞-1𝑥𝑞-1+... +𝑏1𝑥+𝑏0,𝑄(𝑥)≠0
This made me realize that everything we are learning in this unit is a combination of basic forms, and that a deeper understanding of basic forms is an important start.

What are the simplest polynomial and rational function you can imagine?

Two examples of simple polynomial functions are given below. The first one is expressed in the form f(x)=mx+b. As we learned in the previous unit, this is a straight line with slope m and intercept b.
Next, f(x)=ax^2+bx+c. When graphed, it is a parabola. If we can think of the general system as f(x)=a(x+a/b)^2+C, we can also understand that the vertex is (-a/b,C).
We have already learned these concepts in the previous unit, and we are reminded that the purpose of this study is to deepen our understanding of general systems.

In your day to day, is there any occurring fact that can be interpreted as polynomial and rational functions?

Compound interest calculation came to mind as a polynomial function. Compound interest calculations are generally given in the form principal*(1+interest)^years. Expanding this, it can be viewed as a polynomial function related to interest.
Next, as for rational functions, the first one that came to mind is the one expressed in the form f(x)=tanx.
The first thing that came to mind was a rational function in the form f(x)=tanx. tanx is a rational function defined by sinx/cosx, a concept that I used very often in my physics studies.

What strategy are you using to get the graph of polynomial and rational functions?

A) polynomial function
The basic procedure is as follows

1. find a simple point
We first calculate the situation when f(x)=0 or f(0). These points can be obtained by factorization or substitution. 2.
2. finding the slope between points
After finding points that are easy to understand, the next step is to consider the slope. It is important to know whether the equation is upward or downward, for example, -∞, +∞, or between points. I have found that the concept of differentiation can be used very usefully in this way.

B) Rational function
The basic procedure is explained below.

1. find a simple point
As in the polynominal function, we organize axial points such as f(x)=0, f(0), etc. 2.
2) Check for points where the denominator can be zero
Due to the characteristics of rational functions, it is not possible to define a point where the denominator is zero, but rather it can take on an infinite number of values, either + or -. It is important to check where such a point is and whether it diverges toward + or - when drawing a graph.
