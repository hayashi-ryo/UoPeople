I will be discussing polynomial functions and examples of using them in this assignment. First, a polynomial function is defined as follows according to the text:
"Let n be a non-negative integer. A polynomial function is a function that can be written in the form
f(x)=anx^n+...+a2x^2+a1x+a0" (Abramson, 2017)

This shape can be used to describe phenomena around us and is modeled in various forms. In this case, I will use a polynomial function to describe the area between a circle and a square inside the circle.

The area I want to find this time is given by the area of the circle - the area of the square, so I will check each of these.

Area of a circle
First, consider a circle h(x) with radius x. This area is expressed by h(x)=πx^2.

Area of a square
Next, consider a square existing in the circle h(x), whose length from the intersection of the diagonals is given by t. The area S(t) of this square is
S(t)=t*t/2*4=2t^2
where given the condition "half the radius x of the circle h(x) plus 1" as the condition for t:
t=x/2+1
and therefore S(t) is a function of x:
S(x)=2(x/2+1)^2
=x^2/2+2x+2

Area F(x) to be obtained
Finally, I calculate the area F(x) that we wish to find. Since we can subtract the area of the square from the area of the circle calculated so far:
F(x)=h(x)-S(x)
=πx^2-(x^2/2+2x+2)
=(π-1/2)x^2-2x-2
This is a polynomial function whose highest degree is 2.
Also, before graphing this function, let's review the area. Since the square must lie inside the circle
t<=x
must be inside the circle. We can organize this using t=x/2+1
x/2+1<=x
-x/2<=-1
x>=2
So the function F(x) is defined in the domain of [2. infinite) and can be expressed as follows:
