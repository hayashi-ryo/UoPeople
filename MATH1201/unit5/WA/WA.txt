1. A retirement account is opened with an initial deposit of $8,500 and earns 8.12% interest compounded monthly. What will the account be worth in 20 years? What if the deposit was calculated using simple interest? Could you see the situation in a graph? From what point one is better than the other?

From the text, the formula for compound interest calculation is given by:

A(t)=P(1+r/n)^{nt}
A(t) is the account value,
t is measured in years,
P is the starting amount of the account, often called the principal, or more generally present value,
r is the annual percentage rate (APR) expressed as a decimal, and
n is the number of compounding periods in one year.
(Abramson, 2017)

In this issue, the respective settings are as follows.

t is 20 years
P is an initial deposit of $8500
r is 8.12%(0.0812)
n is 12 months

Therefore, the following equation can be obtained by substituting each value.

A(20)=8500(1+0.0812/12)^{12*20}
=42888.18
Thus, the account balance after 20 years with compound interest would be $42888.18.

For simple interest, the calculation can be made in the following form

A(t)=P(1+nt)
=8500*(1+0.0812*20)
=22303

Thus, the account balance after 20 years in the simple interest case is $22303.
As a result, the account balance after 20 years will be larger in the case of compound interest. A graphical representation of each investment is shown below.

The graph shows that the compounding calculation has exponential growth. Also, at the end of one year, the account balance is higher for the compound interest calculation.

2.  Graph the function  f(x)=5(o.5)^{-x}  and its reflection about the line y=x on the same axis, and give the x-intercept of the reflection. Prove that  a^x=e^{x lna} . [Suggestion: type  y=5(0.5^{-x})  {- 7 < x < 2}  {0 < y < 7} in desmos, and then type its inverse function.]

I find the inverse function of y=5(0.5)^{-x}. To find the inverse function, solve the equation for y by replacing x and y, and so on.
Calculation of
y=5(0.5)^{-x}
x=5(1/2)^{-y} Interchange x and y
x/5=(1/2)^{-y} divide both sides by 5
ln(x/5)=ln((1/2)^{-y}) Take the ordinary logarithm
lnx-ln5=-y(ln1-ln2) Decompose the ordinary logarithm
lnx-ln5=yln2
y=(lnx-ln5)/ln2
Therefore, I were able to find the inverse function of y=5(0.5)^{-x}. The graph is shown below.

The graph shows that the x-intercept is 5. Also, a^x=e^{x lna} can be proved by taking the ordinary logarithm of both sides.
a^x=e^{x lna}
ln(a^x)=ln(e^{x lna})
xlna=xlna(lne)
x=x


First, I prove that K= \frac{ln0.5}{T}. In the decay equation, A(T)/A_0=0.5 holds because half of the matter decays in the half-life. Use this to organize the decay equation

A(T)=A_0e^{KT}
A(T)/A_0=e^{KT} Divide both sides by A_0
0.5=e^{KT} Substitute A(T)/A_0=0.5
of both sides
ln(0.5)=KTlne
K=ln(0.5)/T

Thus K= \frac{ln0.5}{T} could be proved.
Next, we will find the time required for 20% of uranium-235 to decay. From the text, we know that the half-life of uranium-235 is 703,800,000 years. In addition, since 20% decays, if the first sample has 1000 grams, we can find the time when 800 grams remain, so we perform the calculation.
800=1000e^{Kt}
0.8=e^{Kt}
ln(0.8)=ln(e^{Kt})
ln(0.8)=Ktlne
t=ln(0.8)/K
t=ln(0.8)*(703,800,000/ln(0.5)
t=226572993
Thus, the time it takes for 20% of the sample to decay is 226,572,993 YEARS.
