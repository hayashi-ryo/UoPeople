As a prerequisite to the question, I will deal with the complex plane. In the previous units, I have studied the x-y plane, where a point (x,y) can be plotted, and besides the x-y plane, two other planes can represent parameters of that point: the polar coordinate form and the complex plane. Let us consider a point z=z+iy in the complex plane. Conversion to polar coordinate form can be done by using the following relation
x=rcosθ
y=rsinθ
r=sqrt(x^2+y^2)
Thus, any point z can be expressed in polar coordinate form as z=r(cosθ+isinθ). I can also obtain two polar coordinate relations from the text.
𝑧1𝑧2=𝑟1𝑟2[cos(𝜃1+𝜃2)+𝑖sin(𝜃1+𝜃2)]
 𝑧1/𝑧2=𝑟1/𝑟2[cos(𝜃1-𝜃2)+𝑖sin(𝜃1-𝜃2)]
This relationship, called De Moivre's theorem, can be used to obtain the following relationship
If 𝑧=𝑟(cos𝜃+𝑖sin𝜃) is a complex number, then
𝑧𝑛=𝑟𝑛[cos(𝑛𝜃)+𝑖sin(𝑛𝜃)]
n is a positive integer
The above relationship allows for easy computation of powers of complex numbers. In the case of power roots, the following relation can be obtained
To find the 𝑛th root of a complex number in polar form, use the formula given as
 𝑧1𝑛=𝑟1𝑛[cos(𝜃𝑛+2𝑘𝜋𝑛)+𝑖sin(𝜃𝑛+2𝑘𝜋𝑛)]
where 𝑘=0,1,2,3,...,𝑛-1. ,𝑛-1. I add 2𝑘𝜋𝑛 to 𝜃𝑛 to obtain the periodic roots.
This relation allows us to easily perform K-san on the roots of complex numbers.
I believe that the biggest learning in this unit is that by representing and formalizing complex numbers in a polar coordinate system, the computation of products, quotients, powers, and roots can be easily performed.
This relationship makes it easy to perform products, quotients, powers, and roots of complex numbers. Also, as noted in the calculation process, these z-relationships hold at all points on any complex plane.
In the following, I will consider some specific examples.
