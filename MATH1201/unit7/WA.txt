1. Find the length of an arc in a circle of radius 10 centimeters subtended by the central angle of 50°. Show your work.

The length of the arc(s) can be obtained by the following equation:
s=rθ
r:radius
θ:radians
(Abramson, 2017)
To perform the calculation, 50° is corrected to radians
θ=50*π/180
=5π/18
Therefore, the length of the arc is
s=rθ
=10*5π/18
=25π/9
~8.72(centimeters)

2. Graph  f(x)=x\ sin\ x  on [-4π, 4π] and verbalize how the graph varies from the graphs of  f(x)= \pm x  

A graphical representation of f(x)=xsinx and f(x)=+-x is as follows
Figure
From this graph, I can see the following
f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 2pi because sinx is kept inside the function.
The graph has a point of intersection with y=+x at x=pi/2 and 5pi/2, which are the vertices of the graph, indicating that x is given as an element to determine the amplitude of f(x).　For y=-x, with intersection at x=3pi/2 or 7pi/2

Next consider f(x)=sinx/x. Since 1/x determines the amplitude of this function, I represent f(x)=+-1/x together as a graph.
Figure.
From this graph, I can see the following
f(x) is a periodic function with a period of 2pi because sinx is kept inside the function.
The graph has a point of intersection with y=+1/x at x=pi/2 and 5pi/2, which are the vertices of the graph, indicating that x is given as the factor that determines the amplitude of f(x). y=-1/x has a point of intersection at x=3pi/2 and 7pi/2.

3. A 23-ft ladder leans against a building so that the angle between the ground and the ladder is 80°. How high does the ladder reach up the side of the building? Show the steps of your reasoning.

The situation is expressed in a diagram as follows
Figure.
Thus, the height reached by the ladder can be calculated by using the trigonometric relationship
Height (h) = length of ladder x sin(80°)
=23*sin(80*pi/180)
~ 22.65(ft)
Therefore, the ladder reaches a height of 22.65-ft.
