Hello classmates, I will explain my response to this assignment below.
Before proceeding with the assignment, it is necessary to first review f^{-1}. f^{-1} is called an inverse function, and according to the text, it has the following properties.
  A function f(x) is called an inverse function if f^{-1}(f(x))=x.
This property shows that the correspondence between y and x, indicated by y=mx+b, etc., is inverse.
Based on the above, let us consider the graph of an inverse function. In this case, we will consider the function y=3x+5. The inverse function can be obtained by the following process:

1) Create an equation in which y and x are interchanged.
The equations, interchanged for y and x, are listed below.
x=3y+5
2) Organize for y
I can now rearrange the equation obtained in 1)
x=3y+5
3y=x-5
y=1/3x-5/3
Thus I have found the inverse function f^{-1})(x)=1/3x-5/3 for f(x)=3y+5. To be sure, let us check it using the definition.
f^{-1}(f(x))=1/3(3x+5)-5/3
=x+5/3-5/3
=x

From the above, we have confirmed that I have obtained an equation that satisfies the definition. Next, I graph f(x) and f^{-1}(x).

If I check this graph, I will see a graph with reflections for y=x. (For clarity, we have added y=x, which is shown below.)
Thus, the very important finding obtained by this assignment is that the output is a reflection of the original function concerning y=x.

It was suggested in the assignment
y=x^3 {-2 < x < 2}, y=x^{1/3} {-2 < x < 2}, and y = x {-2 < x < 2}
The same confirmatory results were obtained.
