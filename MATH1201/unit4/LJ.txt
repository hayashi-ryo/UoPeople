・Reflect on the concept of composite and inverse functions. What concepts (only the names) did you need to accommodate these concepts in your mind?

I'll explain my understanding of composite and inverse functions learned in this unit.

1. Composite function
First, let's talk about composite functions. According to the text, composite functions are described as follows:
"The process of combining functions so that the output of one function becomes the input of another is known as a composition of functions. The resulting function is known as a composite function."(Abramson, 2017)
In addition, the composite function of f(x) and g(x) is notated as follows:
(f・g)(x)=f(g(x))
The explanation in the text helped my understanding immensely. I now understand that these composite functions explain how two seemingly unrelated things can be connected by a relationship.

2. Inverse function
Second, let's talk about inverse functions. Inverse functions are described in the following sentence in the text, which helped my understanding.
"Informally, this means that inverse functions “undo” each other."(Abramson, 2017)
Using the idea of composite functions, the inverse function f^{-1} can be expressed as follows
(f/f^{-1})(x)=f(f^{-1}(x))=f(y)=x
This shows that the inverse function and the original function have a point of symmetry about the axis y=x.

・What are the simplest composite and inverse functions you can imagine?
1. Composite function
As the simplest composite function, I consider the composition of linear functions.
g(x)=x+5
h(x)=3x-3
and its composite function, f(x)=(g・h)(x), is calculated as follows.
f(x)=(g・h)(x)
=g(h(x))
=(3x-3)+5
=3x+2
Thus, I have computed the composite function f(x)=3x+2.

2. Inverse function
For an example of a simple inverse function, consider the inverse function for f(x)=3x^3. The calculation process is shown below.
y=3x^3
x=1/3y^{1/3}
Therefore, f^{-1}(x)=1/3y^{1/3} could be calculated.

・In your day to day, is there any occurring fact that can be interpreted as composite and inverse functions?
1. Composite function
As an example of a composite function, I considered the relationship between a map and temperature. If I consider a map with contour lines drawn, I can find the height of a certain coordinate from the map. Let g denote this relationship. Furthermore, let h be the relationship between height and temperature. By combining g and h, I can generate a relation f that identifies the temperature from the coordinates. This is an example of a very simple composite function using two relations.

2. Inverse function
I considered shopping as an example of an inverse function. For example, suppose a cup of coffee is sold for 200 yen. The total amount of money when x cups of this coffee are bought can be expressed by the relation f(x)=200x. Now consider the relation "how many cups of coffee can I buy with x yen? This relationship is called g(x). This relationship can be expressed as g(x)=x/200. These two functions f(x) and g(x) satisfy the inverse function relationship.
f(g(x))=200(x/200)
=x

・What strategy are you using to get the graph of composite and inverse functions?
1. Composite function
Just because it is a composite function does not mean that you need to perform any special operations to graph it. First, I can calculate the composite function and then graph it in a way that is appropriate to the result of the calculation. The result may take many forms, including polynomial functions and rational functions, but I have learned how to graph them in previous units.

2. Inverse function
The inverse function has the relationship that it has points symmetric to y=x. Of course, as with composite functions, I can compute the inverse function and create its graph according to the form, but in some cases, it is easier to collect points subject to y=x, so I want to choose a strategy and create a graph according to the form of the original graph.
