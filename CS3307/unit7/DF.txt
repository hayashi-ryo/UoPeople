Hello, classmate. I will explain my understanding of the theme for this time.
Operating systems offer a variety of utility tools to support system performance and resource management. These tools are indispensable for daily system optimization and troubleshooting.
This article introduces three powerful tools: `top` and `df` for Linux, and Process Monitor for Windows. Each tool excels in different areas of efficient system management, which will be detailed below.

### Linux: top - Real-Time Process Management Tool

`top` is a tool that displays real-time information about processes and resource usage in Linux systems. It is particularly helpful for quickly identifying processes with high CPU or memory usage.

Key Features
Provides dynamically updated, real-time information.
Offers visual displays of CPU, memory, and process states.
Allows stopping processes or adjusting their priority with ease.

Use Case
During system operations, using `top` to monitor CPU and memory usage trends enables the identification of high-load processes. This helps in implementing appropriate measures such as optimizing processing or adjusting timeout settings.

### Linux: df - Disk Usage Monitoring Tool

`df` is a utility that displays disk usage and available space for each file system. Since running out of disk space poses significant risks to system operations, `df` is an essential tool for regular monitoring.

Key Features
Displays disk usage and available space for each file system.
Outputs data in a human-readable format using the `-h` option.

Use Case
Before installing new software, `df` can be used to ensure sufficient disk space is available. Additionally, when disk space approaches its limit, it assists in planning the deletion of unnecessary files.

### Windows: Process Monitor - Advanced Process Monitoring Tool

Process Monitor is an advanced monitoring tool for Windows systems. It specializes in troubleshooting by providing real-time data on file systems, registries, and network activities.

Key Features
Offers advanced filtering capabilities to focus on specific processes.
Monitors detailed activities such as file access and registry operations.
Quickly identifies the causes of system anomalies or errors.

Use Case
It is particularly useful for investigating the causes of application crashes. By checking logs at the time of an error, it provides valuable clues for problem resolution.

### Comparison and Conclusion

`top` is an excellent tool for process management and resource monitoring, enabling quick evaluation of system performance. On the other hand, `df` specializes in storage management, offering essential information for effective disk space usage. Finally, Process Monitor is an indispensable tool for detailed troubleshooting in Windows systems.
Utilizing these tools significantly improves the efficiency of system management. Select and use the appropriate tool according to your objectives to enhance your operational capabilities.
