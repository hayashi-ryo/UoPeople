Hello, classmate. I will explain my understanding of the theme for this time.
In programming tasks, both IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) and text editors are essential tools. However, when prioritizing efficiency and productivity, I recommend using IDEs. Especially in software development and operating system coding, the features provided by IDEs greatly contribute to the success of projects. This response explains the reasons with concrete examples.

Advantages of IDEs
IDEs offer numerous features that enhance developers’ productivity. For example, IDEs like Visual Studio and IntelliJ IDEA integrate code completion, error checking, and debugging tools. These features allow developers to identify and fix errors in real time during coding. Moreover, the integrated project management features enable efficient handling of multiple files and libraries.
A specific example is kernel development for operating systems. In such complex projects, error tracking and code completion features are crucial. Notably, Microsoft’s Visual Studio, with its multilingual support and advanced debugging tools, is widely regarded as an industry standard (Microsoft, n.d.). These features empower developers to create efficient and precise code.

Advantages of Plain Text Editors
On the other hand, text editors also have certain advantages. Tools like Vim and Emacs are suitable for operations on remote servers or environments with limited resources. Additionally, text editors are lightweight, making them ideal for quickly starting tasks in situations where launching a large-scale IDE might take time.
Vim, in particular, is renowned for its simplicity and efficiency. It is an indispensable tool for server management and infrastructure configuration tasks, as it operates on the command line (Ramakrishnan, 2021). When editing files on remote servers via SSH, such lightweight editors enable smoother workflows compared to IDEs.

Comparison
The choice between IDEs and text editors depends on the project’s scale and objectives. However, in general, IDEs demonstrate overwhelming advantages in large-scale projects requiring sophisticated development environments. For instance, Eclipse, an open-source IDE, is highly valued for its flexibility and plugin extensibility in large-scale Java projects (Eclipse Foundation, n.d.).
Conversely, text editors are effective in niche scenarios but lack features like code completion and integration, which may impose productivity constraints in the long term. In particular, when visualizing the overall system structure or managing complex dependencies, IDEs are a far superior option.

Conclusion
For these reasons, I recommend using IDEs for programming tasks. IDEs’ efficiency-enhancing tools are indispensable, particularly in large-scale projects and team development. However, text editors also serve as viable options in specific situations.
