## Discussion Forum

In your implementation of the ALU there is no need to detect or handle overflow.  However, it's a good mental exercise to think about when/how an overflow might occur.  When adding numbers with different signs, overflow cannot occur because the sum must be no larger than one of the numbers.
What happens when the signs of the numbers are the same? What happens in the case of subtraction?
How do we detect when an overflow does occur?
