## Reading Assignment

- Tarnoff, D. (2007). Computer organization and design fundamentals. <http://faculty.etsu.edu/tarnoff/138292/>
  - Chapter 3: Binary Math and Number Representations
- Nisan, N., & Schocken, S. (2005). The elements of computing systems. MIT Press. <http://f.javier.io/rep/books/The%20Elements%20of%20Computing%20Systems.pdf>
  - Chapter 2: Boolean Arithmetic

## Discussion Forum

- How many gates are used in the implementation of the Xor gate in the Nissan and Schocken textbook?
- Present your implementation to the Xor chip. How many gates are there in your implementation?
- Please use engineer's logic and your textook to answer the following:
- Can you think of a more efficient implementation?
- Efficiency is not necessarily the number of gates used. It's all about "following the money." In other words, what does it cost to implement a new gate?
