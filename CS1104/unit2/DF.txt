Hello classmates. I would like to explain my understanding of this topic.

How many gates are used in the implementation of the Xor gate in the Nissan and Schocken textbook?

figure

The text uses five gates to implement the XOR gate: two AND gates, two NOT gates, and one OR gate.

Present your implementation to the Xor chip. How many gates are there in your implementation?

I came up with the following implementation of an XOR gate.

figure

This circuit was implemented based on a logic equation to find a way to implement an XOR gate with fewer circuits than the text.

Please use engineer's logic and your textook to answer the following:
Can you think of a more efficient implementation? Efficiency is not necessarily the number of gates used. It's all about "following the money." In other words, what does it cost to implement a new gate?

I considered that a necessary element from the standpoint of "efficient" is to build it with a single primitive circuit. This is because I believed that if I could build it with only one circuit, I would be able to implement cost reduction through mass production. Following this concept, an XOR circuit implemented with only NAND gates is shown below.
