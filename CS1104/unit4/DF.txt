Hello classmates. Let me explain my understanding of this topic.
A D latch is a circuit that holds the value of a specific timing data input generated by a clock input. Therefore, it cannot change its output according to the value of the input or store the state. The D flip-flop is a circuit that solves these problems. The difference is that there are two values as outputs, and their values are always opposite. This characteristic allows the output to change according to the state of the input value, which is not possible with the D latch.
DFF can also be implemented by connecting two D latches. By setting the input of the second D latch to the output of the first latch and the inverted value of the clock input, the operation of a D flip-flop can be realized. This takes advantage of the characteristic of the D latch to output the input value as it is according to the state of the clock input.
