## Discussion Forum

In your assigned readings, you learned how cells divide in order to replace damaged and dead cells. Normally, division is regulated resulting in healthy functional tissue. Cancer occurs when normal regulation of cell division is lost and becomes uncontrolled. Uncontrolled division results in massive reproduction of abnormal cells. Cancer is the result of unchecked cell division caused by a breakdown of the mechanisms that regulate the cell cycle. The loss of control begins with a change in the DNA sequence of a gene that codes for one of the regulatory molecules. Faulty instructions lead to a protein that does not function as it should. Any disruption of the monitoring system can allow other mistakes to be passed on to the daughter cells. Each successive cell division will give rise to daughter cells with even more accumulated damage. Eventually, all checkpoints become nonfunctional, and rapidly reproducing cells crowd out normal cells, resulting in a tumor or leukemia (blood cancer).

For this discussion, you will select a specific cancer. What cell type is affected? Describe the defect in cellular reproduction responsible for the cancer. Discuss therapy available for treatment of the disorder. Does the therapy treat the symptoms or the genetic nature of the disease? Explain.

## Learning Journal

In your readings, you learned about cellular division in both plant and animal cells. While they are similar in many ways, some key differences occur late in the mitotic division. Describe the similarities and differences between the cytokinesis mechanisms found in animal cells versus those in plant cells. Compose your work and submit to your Learning Journal.
