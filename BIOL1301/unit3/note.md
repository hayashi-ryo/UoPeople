## Discussion Forum

In your assigned readings, you learned how cells utilize energy. Discuss the importance of electrons in the transfer of energy in living systems. Be sure to use a specific example in your discussion.

Be sure to use in text citation and provide references for your sources. While not required for this discussion, you may use outside resources. Any materials cited in this course should be referenced using the APA style guidelines  Purdue University’s Online Writing LAB (OWL) is a free website that provides excellent information and resources for understanding and using the APA format and style. The OWL website can be accessed here: <http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/>

## Written Assignment

How do drugs work?

Many drugs, legal or not, work by either stimulating or inhibiting specific metabolic enzymes. As such, products of metabolic reactions can be selectively increased or decreased depending on the drug’s mechanism of action in the cell. In your readings, you learned that statins are a class of drugs used to reduce cholesterol levels. Their mechanism of action is to inhibit the enzyme HMG-CoA reductase. HMG-CoA reductase is the enzyme that synthesizes cholesterol from lipids in the body. By inhibiting this enzyme, the levels of cholesterol synthesized in the body can be reduced.
You will research and present a drug of your choosing for this assignment. You are free to chose any drug as long as it works by inhibiting a specific enzyme; e.g., statins. You cannot, however, use statins.

Write a 2-3 page (500 – 750 words, 12 point font) paper including the following elements. Be sure to compose your work with your own words. Do not copy and paste from any source.

- Identify the drug as synthetic or biological/natural and describe the chemical structure.
- Describe how the chemical structure of the drug is necessary for function; i.e., cellular mechanism of action.
- Identify the drug as either a competitive or allosteric inhibitor. Describe how this works.
- Identify one or more adverse effects of the drug. Explain the effect based on the drug’s effect on metabolism.
- Use in-text citation and provide source references for at least 3 sources. The textbook can be one source.
- Check all content for grammar, spelling and be sure that you have properly cited all resources (in APA format) used. Refer to the UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC for help with APA citations.
