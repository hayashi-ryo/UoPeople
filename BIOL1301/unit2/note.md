## Discussion Forum

In your assigned readings, you learned about biological molecule synthesis and degradation. Our cells are busy both building and breaking down macromolecules for both structural and functional purposes. Enzymes are necessary for the effective synthesis and degradation of macromolecules. Metabolic diseases result from either the lack of or defective enzymes. For this discussion, you will select a specific metabolic disorder. Describe the defect in metabolism responsible for the disorder identifying any enzyme(s) involved. Analyze the symptoms of the disease based on the metabolic disturbance. Discuss therapy available for treatment of the disorder. Does the therapy treat the symptoms or the metabolic nature of the disease? Explain.

## Written Assignment

## Learning Journal

Assignment: Create a table comparing the four major biological macromolecules: carbohydrates, lipids, proteins, and nucleic acids. Your table must include the following elements: monomer building blocks, nature of monomer, specific examples (more than one), specific functions (more than one). You can create a table using MS Word. The more you put into this table, the better prepared you will be for the quiz.
