## Discussion Forum

In your assigned readings, you learned how inductive and deductive reasoning are used to answer questions about life. Briefly compare and contrast each type of reasoning as they apply to biological investigation. Which, if any, type of reasoning is best used to establish cause and effect relationships? Explain your rationale using one or more examples.

## Written Assignment

## Learning Journal

The role of carbon is central to the molecules that make up life. Please answer the questions below:  

1. What makes ionic bonds different from covalent bonds? Explain your answer and add sources/citations to support your answer.  
2. Why are hydrogen bonds and van der Waals interactions necessary for cells? Explain your answer and add sources/citations to support your answer.  
3. Describe the significance of carbon and the three essential elements required for life on Earth.
