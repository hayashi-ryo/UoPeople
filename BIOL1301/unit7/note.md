  - Chapter 18.1 and 18.2
  - Chapter 19.1
  - Chapter 20.1

## Discussion Forum

In your assigned readings, you learned how evidence is used to support the theory of evolution. Using examples, briefly discuss how evidence is used to support evolution. Do you agree with the use of this data/evidence? Explain your position.
Be sure to use in text citation and provide references for your sources. While not required for this discussion, you may use outside resources. Any materials cited in this course should be referenced using the APA style guidelines  Purdue University’s Online Writing LAB (OWL) is a free website that provides excellent information and resources for understanding and using the APA format and style. The OWL website can be accessed here: <http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/>.

## Written Assignment

An adaptation or adaptive trait is a trait/characteristic that has evolved in a population of organisms which provides a functional advantage. Adaptations increase the biological fitness of a population. Fitness is defined as the ability to survive and pass genes on to subsequent generations.
For the purposes of this assignment, you are to choose an adaptive trait common to more than one species. For example, birds and bats both have wings. Write a 2-3 page (500 – 750 words, 12 point font) paper including the following elements. Be sure to compose your work with your own words. Do not copy and paste from any source.

- Describe what makes this trait an adaptation.
- Briefly describe how the trait evolved; e.g., mutation, genetic drift, migration and/or natural selection. Be sure to support your answer with evidence.
- What is the difference between homologous and analogous traits? How does your trait of choice fit either of these descriptions?
- What is convergent and divergent evolution? Describe whether the trait is a result of convergent or divergent evolution.
- Use in-text citation and provide source references for at least 3 sources. The textbook can be one source.
- Check all content for grammar, spelling and be sure that you have properly cited all resources (in APA format) used. Refer to the UoPeople APA Tutorials in the LRC for help with APA citations.

## Learning Journal

Assignment: In your readings, you learned about evolution and natural selection. Reflect on what you have learned about evolution and sustainability and conduct more research using the Internet, LIRN, and Google Scholar to respond to the following:
Explain how human influences impact sustainability, evolution, and natural selection (reproduction, specification, and mutations)?
