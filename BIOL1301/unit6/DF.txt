The endosymbiotic theory is one of the main hypotheses explaining the process by which eukaryotic cells evolved from prokaryotic organisms. According to this theory, early eukaryotic cells evolved through symbiotic relationships with different prokaryotic organisms. The following describes the hypothesized steps for the evolution of eukaryotic cells.
Firstly, around 2 billion years ago, archaea (a type of prokaryote) began incorporating other prokaryotic organisms, specifically aerobic bacteria, into their cells. This incorporation evolved because the symbiotic relationship was mutually beneficial. Aerobic bacteria could efficiently generate energy using oxygen, which was advantageous for the host archaea. This stable symbiotic relationship eventually led to the evolution of the incorporated bacteria into mitochondria (Margulis, 1970).
Next, some eukaryotic cells further evolved by incorporating photosynthetic bacteria, such as cyanobacteria. These bacteria evolved into chloroplasts, gaining the ability to generate energy through photosynthesis. This process led to the emergence of photosynthetic eukaryotes, which are the ancestors of modern plants.
There is extensive evidence supporting the endosymbiotic theory. For instance, mitochondria and chloroplasts have their own DNA, which is similar in structure to the DNA of specific existing bacteria. Additionally, these organelles have double membranes, reflecting the original membranes of the ingested bacteria and the host cell (Cavalier-Smith, 2006). Furthermore, mitochondria and chloroplasts possess their own ribosomes, which resemble those of prokaryotes, suggesting their endosymbiotic origins (Lane & Martin, 2010).
From my perspective, the endosymbiotic theory is the most convincing explanation for the evolution of eukaryotic cells. Numerous genetic and biochemical pieces of evidence support this theory, and it has fewer inconsistencies compared to other theories.
