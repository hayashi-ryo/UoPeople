## Discussion Forum

In your assigned readings, you learned about different theories for the evolution of eukaryotic cells from prokaryotic organisms. Describe the hypothesized steps for the evolution of eukaryotic cells via endosymbiosis. How is evidence used to support this theory? Explain your position.

Be sure to use in text citation and provide references for your sources. While not required for this discussion, you may use outside resources. Any materials cited in this course should be referenced using the APA style guidelines  Purdue University’s Online Writing LAB (OWL) is a free website that provides excellent information and resources for understanding and using the APA format and style. The OWL website can be accessed here: <http://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/>

## Learning Journal

In your assigned readings, you were introduced to the major animal phyla. Choose an animal which represents a particular phylum. Briefly describe its features characteristic of its phylum including morphology, embryology, and physiology. Identify adaptations of your animal compared with other animals. If you chose a more primitive animal, identify adaptations compared with more primitive organisms outside of the animal kingdom.
