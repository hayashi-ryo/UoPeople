Overview of the Week
This week, I studied CMS (Content Management Systems), particularly focusing on acquiring skills related to the installation and configuration of Joomla CMS. Specifically, I learned about the benefits of CMS systems for organizations, developers, and users, and demonstrated my ability to install Joomla CMS. Additionally, I deepened my understanding of Joomla’s configuration process and the steps involved in creating web pages, as well as learning how to add new modules.

My Thoughts
Through this week’s learning, I realized how efficiently CMS can manage websites. I was especially impressed by how easy it was to install and configure Joomla, allowing me to build a website in just a few steps. In traditional web development, HTML, CSS, and PHP had to be manually coded, but using Joomla, I found that it was possible to manage content and modify the site’s design without writing any code, which greatly saved time. Despite this being my first time using a CMS, the interface was intuitive and easy to understand, and the process of adding modules and themes was remarkably simple, which I found to be a significant advantage.
What particularly impressed me was the ease of customizing site features by adding extensions. For example, simply adding Joomla modules allowed me to instantly implement features like shopping carts and forums, demonstrating that the site could be flexibly expanded to meet specific needs. Rahman (2018) points out that one of Joomla’s strengths is that “by using a wide variety of extensions, it’s possible to achieve highly flexible and powerful customizations.” After trying out several modules myself, I also felt that this extensibility is a major advantage of Joomla.
Additionally, regarding the benefits of CMS, Mitchell (2013) states that “by simplifying content management, organizations can reduce website operation costs and improve user experience.” Utilizing Joomla, I began to feel the potential for efficiently managing more complex websites in the future. This understanding was further strengthened through the process of building a small site with Joomla. Initially, I was a bit confused since this was my first time building a site using a CMS, but with feedback from the instructor, I was able to gradually deepen my understanding.

What I Learned in Depth
This week, I particularly deepened my understanding of the overall structure of CMS systems and the specific benefits they bring to organizations, developers, and users. First, I realized that the greatest strength of implementing a CMS is that it allows anyone to manage content without needing complex coding knowledge. In particular, open-source CMSs like Joomla are highly flexible and free to use, contributing significantly to cost savings.
Furthermore, during the process of installing and configuring Joomla, I experienced how intuitive and efficient CMS tools can be. The ability to customize the site by selecting templates and modules, and by using drag-and-drop functionality without writing any code, highlighted the convenience of Joomla. Additionally, the fact that new features can be easily added to the website using modules was also impressive. Learning these features made me realize that the effort required for website construction can be greatly reduced.
Moreover, using a CMS enables the separation of design and content, allowing even non-technical users to manage the site, which I understand is a major advantage for organizations. Specifically, the ability for multiple users to edit content simultaneously and easily set access control will be highly useful in practical operations. Moving forward, I plan to challenge myself with module development in Joomla and further advanced customizations, broadening the potential of CMS even further.

Challenges and Goals for Next Week
Next week, I aim to explore the further extensibility of Joomla and learn how to install modules and extensions. Additionally, my goal is to enhance my ability to build custom modules using PHP. Through this process, I hope to not only realize the convenience of CMS systems but also develop more advanced customization skills. Looking ahead, I will also need to consider system security measures and performance optimization, which are crucial areas to address, and I plan to keep these factors in mind as I continue my studies.
