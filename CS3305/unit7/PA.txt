For this assignment, I downloaded and installed an extension called "Latest News Enhanced."

The main features of Latest News Enhanced are as follows:
1. Advanced Filtering Options: It allows articles to be filtered by category, author, or date range, giving precise control over the content displayed.
2. Display Customization: The module offers various layout options, allowing you to show or hide article details such as the author, date, and introduction text.
3. Support for Multiple Templates: It supports multiple templates, making it easier to match the style of the news articles to the design of the site.
4. Performance Improvements: The module includes performance enhancements to optimize the loading time of news articles, especially when managing a large amount of content.
5. Responsive Design: It is fully responsive, ensuring that the news display adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.

Below is a screenshot of the module list screen after executing the download.
