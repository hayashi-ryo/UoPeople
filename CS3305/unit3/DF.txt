Hello, classmate. I will explain my understanding of the theme this time.

Server-side programming languages are essential technologies for executing the backend logic of web applications and online systems. Currently, popular server-side languages include not only PHP but also Python and Node.js. Python has gained popularity due to its simple and readable syntax, as well as its extensive libraries, particularly in the fields of data analysis and artificial intelligence. On the other hand, Node.js is based on JavaScript, allowing developers to use the same language for both the front-end and back-end, which is a significant advantage. Among these options, PHP remains highly supported by developers due to its history of being specialized for web development.

The Popularity of PHP and Reasons for Its Success
PHP is widely popular for several reasons, including being open-source and free, its ease of learning, and a vast community offering support. PHP was initially designed with web development in mind, and its seamless integration with HTML makes it accessible for both beginners and professionals. Moreover, compared to other server-side languages, PHP allows for faster and more straightforward development. While Python and Node.js are also widely used, PHP’s simplicity, along with its numerous libraries and frameworks, makes it particularly attractive.

Examples of Web Applications and Systems Developed with PHP
Some well-known web applications developed with PHP include WordPress, Facebook, and Wikipedia. WordPress, in particular, powers approximately 40% of websites globally and is built on PHP as its foundation. Facebook also started with PHP, and while the platform has evolved, parts of its infrastructure still rely on PHP. Wikipedia is another example, where PHP is praised for its smooth integration with large databases, facilitating the handling of massive amounts of data.

Advanced Features of PHP
PHP continues to evolve, offering numerous advanced features in its latest versions. For example, its support for object-oriented programming (OOP) has made it easier to write reusable code, even in large-scale projects. Additionally, its session management capabilities allow developers to efficiently store login information or shopping cart statuses. PHP’s robust database integration, through PDO (PHP Data Objects) and MySQLi, ensures safe and efficient database operations. Furthermore, the latest PHP versions include features such as type declarations and anonymous classes, enabling more sophisticated and refined development.

Conclusion
PHP is a powerful server-side programming language that is both easy to learn and rich in advanced features. It is trusted in large-scale systems like WordPress and Wikipedia, proving its reliability. As PHP continues to evolve alongside other server-side languages, its wide range of applications will likely persist, making it a valuable tool for web development in the future.
