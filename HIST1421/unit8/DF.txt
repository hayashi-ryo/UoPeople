Modern life has significantly improved compared to ancient Greek and Roman times. While ancient culture and philosophy have greatly influenced us today, contemporary society, with its technological advancements and enhanced political systems, allows us to live in a safer and more prosperous era. Here, I will highlight several reasons to convince an ancient Greek or Roman citizen that the modern era is a better time to be alive.

Social and Political Stability
Modern democracy and the rule of law are crucial elements for ensuring societal stability and fairness. Although the concepts of democracy existed in ancient Greece and Rome, their application was limited, and only a portion of the population could participate in politics. Today, all adults have the right to vote and are guaranteed equal treatment under the law. This ensures societal stability and fairness and protects individual rights (Dahl, 1998).

Advances in Science and Technology
Modern medical technology and infrastructure have significantly improved our quality of life. In ancient times, treatments for diseases and injuries were limited, and many people died from simple infections. Today, advancements in medical technology have made many diseases treatable, and life expectancy has dramatically increased (World Health Organization, 2020). Additionally, infrastructure development has created safe and comfortable living environments (Jackson, 2018).

Access to Education and Information
Modern education systems provide opportunities for everyone. In ancient Greece and Rome, only privileged classes had access to education. Today, anyone can receive an education, and the proliferation of the internet has made access to information significantly easier. This enhances individual knowledge and skills, contributing to the overall development of society.

Personal Freedom and Rights
In modern society, personal freedoms and rights are legally guaranteed. In ancient Greece and Rome, many people, including women and slaves, lacked basic rights and lived under severe restrictions. Today, regardless of gender or race, everyone is treated equally and enjoys freedom. This increases individual happiness and enriches society as a whole.

Conclusion
Compared to ancient Greek and Roman times, the modern era has significantly improved in terms of social stability, advancements in science and technology, access to education and information, and personal freedoms and rights. These elements form the foundation for a richer and safer life. While we are grateful for the influence of ancient culture and philosophy on modern times, we can say that we are living in a very fortunate era, enjoying the benefits of the present.
