The study of Greek and Roman civilizations provides important insights into the understanding of modern political systems and social structures. In particular, Athenian democracy is one of the significant models that formed the foundation of today's democracy. In this discussion, we will compare Athenian democracy with the political system of Japan, where I live, to explore their similarities and differences.
Hello classmates, my name is Ryohei Hayashi, and I live in Japan. Currently, I am majoring in Computer Science at UoPeople. To be honest, I have not had much interest in Greek and Roman civilizations. However, through this course, I hope to learn how ancient political systems and cultures have influenced the modern world.
