Hello, my instructor and my classmates, here are my thoughts on this week's theme.

1. There are two main concepts of learning. Passive learning and active learning. In the former, passive learning, the instructor sets goals for the student according to an established curriculum and communicates the skills necessary to achieve those goals. In this process, students do not control their learning process and are essentially directed by the instructor.
In the latter, active learning, in other words, refers to the self-directed learning that is the topic of this week's unit. This self-directed learning process requires students to take control of their learning, rather than waiting for others to tell them what to do in terms of learning objectives, process, and evaluation. This method has been shown to produce highly effective results because students are driven by their interests and intrinsic motivation.
Thus, there is a difference between active and passive learning in terms of the stance taken in conducting learning. In our university studies and later in our working lives, I am expected to engage in an active learning process.

2. In a nutshell, the course instructor's role is to support student learning. 
According to ”Self-Directed Learning: A Four-Step Process”, the instructor's role in self-directed learning includes:
- Build a co-operative learning environment
- Help to motivate and direct the students' learning experience
- Facilitate students' initiatives for learning
- Be available for consultations as appropriate during the learning process
- Serve as an advisor rather than a formal instructor (Centre for Teaching Excellence, 2020)

These roles will be to provide advice to students as they progress through the learning process, taking the initiative and advising them if they encounter difficulties. I also believe that students may further enhance their learning effectiveness if they know that they have these updates to support them as they move through the learning process.

3. Self-directed learning requires self-assessment of one's progress and status against goals. Peer assessment allows students to improve their reflection skills by evaluating the work products of classmates working on the same topic, concerning guidelines and criteria.
