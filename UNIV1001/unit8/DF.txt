1. From the syllabus of this course, I know that everything I have learned in UNIV1001, unit1 to unit8, will be tested in the final exam. I will then explain my strategy for the exam.

Topic Review
Review the notes and Self-Quizzes that you have created to reflect on what you have learned in each UNIT. This will be completed no later than 3 days before the start of the final exam.

Review using Review quiz
The Review quiz opened in unit9 is designed to test your knowledge of UNIV1001 as a whole. This quiz will be used to finalize your knowledge. I plan to take the final exam on the 13th, so I will aim to have 100% of my knowledge established by the 12th.

Based on the strategies described so far, I would like to obtain satisfactory results in the final examination.

2. I tend to get anxious about exams, no matter how big or small. Once the exam begins, my anxiety dissipates and I can focus on the questions and assignments, but inevitably, the day before the exam, I am so anxious that I want to study even if I have to cut back on sleep. In these cases, I take several steps to embrace my anxiety rather than eliminate it.

Conduct ongoing studies
The anxiety I have is inevitably unrelieved. Therefore, to accept the anxiety as burden-free as possible, I build up my self-confidence through continuous study. This will make the anxiety I have smaller and easier to accept.

Perform a change of scenery
It is similar to the stress reduction methods learned in unit7, but the anxiety I feel can be forgotten for the time I am focused on something else. Therefore, exercise and conversations with friends give me room to embrace my anxiety.
