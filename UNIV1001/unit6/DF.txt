1. The Cornell Method was used to create the notebook, which has the following features
   - Divide the notebook in half and write information on the right side.
   - On the left side, important information and questions are written.
   - On the bottom is a summary of the entire document.
The reason for using this method was that the only information given to me when I started the assignment was the title and summary of the video, and I thought that I would not be able to produce a good output if I started the assignment without any objectives, so I decided to use this method because it allows me to set questions such as "What are Carbon Offsets? and  "What is the problem".

2. I think it is a very useful note-taking method for Active Study: the Cornell Method allows you to clarify what information you want to get from the content before you read the assignment, text, or paper. This characteristic allows for a phase in which you organize the information you have obtained, which helps you to better consolidate the knowledge you have input into your mind.In addition, I think there are situations in which other methods would be useful.
List/Outline: Input is emphasized. This can be used effectively when I want to acquire a large amount of new knowledge.
Concept Map: Enables learning with an awareness of the connections between ideas. It can be used at the end of a course when I want to organize information with an awareness of the overall picture, such as how the ideas you have learned so far are connected.
Thus, I believe that the Cornell Method is a useful strategy for me, but I will select the appropriate strategy to utilize depending on the situation.
