## Discussion Forum

What are the various problems that could arise in Non-Return to Zero (NRZ) encoding if a continuous stream of 0s or 1s is sent?
Instead of writing an essay, try writing in bulleted form, briefly explaining what you understand from the findings.

## Written Assignment

- Answer the following:

1. What is crosstalk? How is it minimized in case of a twisted pair of wire?
2. Why are two separate frequencies used for uplink and downlink transmission in case of satellite communication?
3. Differentiate between the 2 switching techniques (Circuit Switching and Packet Switching).(4 differences)
4. What is the answer to Exercise 2.7 from Section 2 of our textbook with this change: the 4th transmission (B sends to D) does not occur?

## Learning Journal

CRC or Cyclic Redundancy Check is an error control method used in Ethernet where a checksum is computed and appended to the data frame being sent across the channel.
Please explain briefly, in your own words.
why is the CRC put in the trailer rather than in the header of the frame?
