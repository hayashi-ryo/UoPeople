The two main problems with Distance Vector Routing being replaced by Link State Routing are
1. Loop generation: With Distance Vector Routing, updates are propagated asynchronously, which can result in routing loops when a router with temporarily outdated information receives information from a router with newer information. This is especially problematic in environments where changes occur frequently in the network topology.
2. Slow convergence: Distance Vector Routing can take a long time for all routers to recognize a change and recalculate the optimal route. In large networks, this convergence time can be problematic. This delay is especially noticeable when a failure occurs and a quick recovery is required.
To solve these problems, Link State Routing was adopted, in which each router has an overall view of the network and independently calculates the optimal route, eliminating loop problems and speeding up convergence. In addition, when the state of the network changes, only the portions that have changed can be propagated quickly, resulting in more efficient routing.
