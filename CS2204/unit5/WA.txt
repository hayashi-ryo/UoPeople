Q1
To find out the router's destination, it is necessary to check the address range from the one with the largest number of bits indicating the network address.

Address/Mask
Next Hop
Address Range
135.46.56.0/22
Interface 0
135.46.56.1～135.46.59.254
135.46.60.0/22
Interface 1
135.46.60.1～135.46.63.254
192.53.40.0/23
Router 1
192.53.40.1～192.53.41.254
Default
Router 2
-


Use this result to see where each address can be reached:
1. 135.46.63.10
It is included in the address range of 135.46.60.0/22, so it reaches Interface 1. 2.
2. 135.46.57.14
It is included in the address range of 135.46.56.0/22, so Interface 0 is reached. 3.
3. 135.46.52.2
It is not included in any address range, so it reaches Router 2, which is Default. 4.
4. 192.53.40.7
It is included in the address range of 192.53.40.0/23, so it reaches Router 1. 5.
5. 192.53.56.7
It is not included in any address range, so it reaches Router 2, which is Default.

Q2

IP addresses are assigned in blocks of powers of two. Therefore, the four organizations are assigned IP addresses A: 4,096, B: 2,048, C: 4,096, and D: 8,192. Using this condition, the corresponding answers for each organization are as follows

Organization A
First IP address: 198.16.0.0
Last IP address: 198.16.15.255
Mask address: 198.16.0.0/20
Organization B
First IP address: 198.16.16.0
Last IP address: 198.16.23.255
Mask address: 198.16.16.0/21
Organization C
First IP address: 198.16.24.0
Last IP address: 198.16.31.255
Mask address: 198.16.24.0/20
Organization D
First IP address: 198.16.32.0
Last IP address: 198.16.63.255
Mask address: 198.16.32.0/19

Q3
The router creates a new distance vector table from the report received from R1. To calculate the new cost to each destination, add the link cost from R to R1 to the cost to each destination provided in the report from R1. Since the cost of the R-R1 link is 1, the new cost to each destination based on the report from R1 is as follows
New cost to A: 1 + 1 = 2
New cost to B: 1 + 1 = 2
New cost to C: 4 + 1 = 5
New cost to D: 4 + 1 = 5
Next, these new costs are compared to the costs in the existing distance vector table.
The cost to A remains the same: 2. The next hop remains R1.
The cost to B has been updated from 3 to 2, a lower cost. The next hop is updated to R1.
The cost to C remains unchanged at 4 after the update, and the next hop remains R1.
The cost to D is updated from 5 to 5 and remains the same, but the next hop may be changed to R1 because there is a route through R1 according to the report, in this case, there are no specific instructions, so the default routing policy is followed.
In conclusion, the distance vector table for R is updated as follows (only changes are noted)
The cost of B is updated from 3 to 2 and the next hop is changed to R1.
