## Discussion Forum

Compare ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and ETHERNET on the following aspects:
Bandwidth
Scalability
Interoperability
Quality of Service
Note any areas where you may want or need some further explanation.  Ask questions of your fellow classmates.

ATM（非同期転送モード）とETHERNETを以下の側面から比較してください：
帯域幅
拡張性
相互運用性
サービス品質
さらに説明が必要な部分があれば、メモしてください。 クラスメートに質問すること。

## Written Assignment

Written Assignment
Networks are designed in a number of ways, based on the geographical area, the technology used, user group specific, application-based, etc. But we can roughly categorize the communication networks in 2 broad categories, based on transmission: Connection-Oriented and Connectionless.

Please discuss the two categories. Your comments should include the following:

Point by point comparison of their advantages and disadvantages (at least 3 advantages and 3 disadvantages)
Point by point comparison of the design issues for both
Your preference among the two and a suggestion to resolve any one of its design-related problem.
Paper Guidelines

2-3 pages in length, in your own words, properly cite any outside resources.  Use 1" margins and Times Roman Font, 12-point, or something comparable.   The paper should be well organized with proper grammar and spelling.

## Learning Journal

While designing a network protocol or setting up a network there are various issues related to the design of the protocol that needs to be addressed like Addressing, Error Control, Flow Control,etc. Make a journal entry for the following question:

What are the design related issues (any two) that needs to be addressed while defining a protocol?

Pick any two issues and, In Your Own Words, very briefly (2-3 statements each) state how can these affect the network, if not taken care of at the time of design.
