Hello classmates, I would like to explain my perspective on this question.
First, let me briefly explain ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) and Ethernet.
ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode)
ATM is a network technology designed primarily for high-speed communications, using fixed-length 53-byte cells to transfer data and to enable the integration of voice, video, and data communications. ATM provides a high level of Quality of Service (QoS) due to its design and is particularly suitable for real-time applications and high bandwidth applications. ATM networks are intended for use in wide area networks (WANs) and carrier networks and have excellent capabilities for bandwidth reservation and traffic management.

Ethernet
Ethernet is a local area network (LAN) technology developed in the 1970s. It uses packet-switching technology to transfer data and is widely used to construct networks in relatively small areas, such as office buildings and campuses. Because of its simplicity, flexibility, and low cost, Ethernet is one of the most popular networking technologies in the world. Speeds vary widely, from an initial 10 Mbps to 1 Gbps (Gigabit Ethernet), and some products offer speeds in excess of 10 Gbps. Ethernet is highly scalable and can be used for everything from small home networks to large enterprise networks.

The following is a comparison of the four perspectives.

Bandwidth
ATM: ATM uses fixed-length cells (53 bytes) to transfer data. ATM networks use Permanent Virtual Circuits (PVCs) and Switched Virtual Circuits (SVCs) to transfer data. Circuits (Switched Virtual Circuits) to guarantee a predefined bandwidth.
Ethernet: Ethernet uses variable frame sizes, is generally low cost, and is widely deployed. It is available in a variety of speeds, including Gigabit Ethernet (1 Gbps) and 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10 Gbps). However, bandwidth is dependent on the physical medium and network congestion, making it difficult to guarantee a pre-defined bandwidth as with ATM.

Scalability
ATM: ATM is highly scalable and can range from small office networks to wide area networks (WANs). It performs particularly well in applications that require quality assurance and service level agreements (SLAs).
Ethernet: Ethernet is also very scalable and can easily expand into larger networks. It is particularly well suited for use in data centers and enterprise networks but can be difficult to provide the same rigorous quality assurance as ATM.

Interoperability
ATM: ATM relies on specific protocols and technologies and has limited interoperability with other network technologies; combining ATM networks with other types of networks may require additional interfaces and protocol conversion.
Ethernet: Ethernet is an industry-standard and widely deployed, making it easily interoperable with many network devices and systems. This makes it easy to build networks using equipment from different vendors.

Quality Assurance
ATM: ATM is designed to provide the rigorous QoS required for real-time applications such as voice and video communications; ATM supports advanced QoS features such as data prioritization, traffic management, and bandwidth guarantees.
Ethernet: Ethernet also provides QoS features, but not as advanced as ATM. Ethernet-based networks may require additional protocols and equipment to implement QoS.

Comparing Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) and Ethernet, the following differences can be distinguished
