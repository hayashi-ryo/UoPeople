1. How are you finding the course?
I am learning about communications technology through the CS2204 course and so far I have been able to move through it without any major problems. The reason for this is that some of the content overlaps with what I have already learned in my current job and the scope of study I have done to obtain the certification. However, I have not studied in a systematic way as much as I have this time, so I am able to proceed with interest.
The only problem is that my workload varies from week to week and I may not be able to take the time to study UoPeople. I am not currently in a situation where it is cutting into my UoP time, but there may be times in March when it will be difficult to find the time, so I need to make sure that I have studied the units in advance.

2. What are the problems that you are facing?
This overlaps with the first question, but so far I have not faced any major problems. I would like to address this by preparing in advance for weeks when I anticipate that it will be difficult to take time off.

3. Are you able to keep up? Are you making use of the Course/Classroom Forum?
I am able to submit course assignments as scheduled. I have also been able to understand the content without any major problems so far. On the screens that I consider difficult to understand, I will ask for help in the course forum.
