The spread of the Internet has led to the digitization of various fields. In particular, E-books-based learning platforms, such as online universities, are expanding. Under these circumstances, I suggest that students actively use E-books for learning. The reason is that E-books have the advantages of convenient searching, centralized management of all materials, and instant online purchase.

One of the main advantages of E-books is the centralized management of all your materials. With paper books, you need to have a lot of materials, such as notebooks and textbooks for each subject. However, with E-books, you can manage them all in one place as data. You can divide them by subject, date, or any other way you want to manage them. Also, since you don't need to carry the actual books, you can move around with only a certain amount of luggage each time. Studying with E-books allows you to learn with a minimum of controlled materials.

E-books are highly searchable. In a paper book, you have to search for keywords by memory. However, if you follow a certain format, it is very easy to find the keywords. It is very significant for mind-mapping learning methods that focus on the connections between words.

E-books are readily available whenever you want them. Platforms such as the Kindle are available 24 hours a day, so you can buy books online whenever you want. It allows you to eliminate the extra lead time of waiting for the book to arrive, and you are focused solely on learning. In addition, valuable and critical materials that were previously difficult to obtain are now readily available online.

With the advent of E-books, people can learn more efficiently. It is also true that some things need to be resolved, such as the communication environment and the initial investment in equipment. However, as we have discussed, E-books will become even more popular in the future due to their various advantages such as efficient search, easy management, and immediate availability. By adopting E-Books as one of the ways to cope with a fast-changing world, our lives will be better for it.
