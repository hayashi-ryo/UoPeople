Introduction
Database systems play an essential role as the backbone of data management in e-commerce. In modern online shopping, the ability to efficiently process and provide vast amounts of customer and product data in real time is critical. By utilizing databases, e-commerce sites can manage transaction information, track inventory, and monitor customer purchasing history, offering services that are both efficient and secure. Recent research highlights the importance of database systems in the growth of e-commerce (Chaffey, 2019).

Shopping Cart and Inventory Management
In e-commerce, databases manage customers' shopping carts and track product inventory in real time. For example, on large online platforms like Amazon, all information about products added to a customer’s cart is stored in the database, allowing the system to instantly track what each customer plans to purchase. Additionally, inventory levels are updated in real time through the database, reducing the risk of selling out-of-stock products to customers (Laudon & Traver, 2020). Recently, I purchased electronic devices on Rakuten, where the shopping cart function facilitated a smooth purchasing experience. These systems support efficient online shopping experiences.

Customer Information Management and Security
Database systems are also utilized to manage customer personal information and purchase history. E-commerce sites store the customer’s data (such as name, address, and payment information) in the database, allowing it to be easily retrieved for future purchases. While efficiently managing this customer data, security measures are equally important. Recent studies show that encryption and access control play a crucial role in protecting customer privacy (Stair & Reynolds, 2018). Sensitive information, such as credit card details and addresses, is encrypted in the database, and multiple layers of security are applied to prevent unauthorized access. One example of secure data management is seen on Etsy, where I recently made a purchase using PayPal, benefiting from their secure transaction system.

Marketing and Personalization
Databases significantly contribute to marketing and personalization efforts on e-commerce sites. By leveraging customer purchasing and browsing history stored in databases, e-commerce sites can provide tailored ads and product recommendations. For instance, YouTube shows me ads based on the products I’ve searched for or the videos I’ve watched. This is made possible through databases that analyze user behavior and provide the most relevant advertisements (Turban et al., 2021). Personalized services like these boost customer engagement and can lead to increased sales for e-commerce platforms.

Conclusion
Database systems are the core technology of e-commerce, vital for managing transaction information, ensuring customer data security, and facilitating personalized marketing. As database technology continues to advance, we can expect even more sophisticated personalization and data management, making e-commerce increasingly convenient and secure. The role of databases will continue to grow in importance, and consumers will benefit from the enhanced services they provide.
