Introduction
Databases play a critical role in modern information systems, and ensuring their reliability requires appropriate backup methods. Backups are essential for protecting systems from data loss or corruption and allow for rapid recovery. Among the most common backup methods in database management systems are differential and incremental backups. This paper discusses the differences between these two types of backups, focusing on their use in database environments, and examines their reliability and effectiveness during recovery.

Definitions of Differential and Incremental Backups
A differential backup captures all data that has changed since the last full backup. It saves a cumulative record of all changes, meaning that during recovery, only the full backup and the latest differential backup are required. In contrast, an incremental backup records only the changes since the most recent backup (whether full or incremental). This method saves smaller chunks of data with each backup.

Differences Between Differential and Incremental Backups
The primary differences between differential and incremental backups lie in the amount of data saved and the time required for recovery. Differential backups record all changes made since the last full backup, so recovery requires less time as only two backups (full and differential) are needed. However, differential backups tend to require more storage as they grow larger with each backup. Incremental backups, on the other hand, save only the most recent changes, making them more efficient in terms of storage, but recovery is more complex because all incremental backups must be processed in sequence (Chen, 2021).

Reliability of Database Backups and Restores
The reliability of a database backup is closely tied to how smoothly the recovery process can be executed. Differential backups offer a more straightforward recovery process, requiring only the full backup and the latest differential backup. In contrast, incremental backups are more prone to complications, as each incremental step must be intact for a full recovery. If one incremental backup is corrupted, the entire recovery process can fail (Jones & Smith, 2020). To ensure reliability, it is recommended that backups are regularly tested for integrity and that redundant copies are kept to safeguard against failures.

Conclusion
Both differential and incremental backups have their advantages and disadvantages, and they should be chosen based on the specific requirements of the system. Differential backups are well-suited for small databases or short-term backup strategies due to their faster recovery times. Incremental backups, on the other hand, offer greater storage efficiency and are ideal for large databases or environments where frequent backups are needed. Ultimately, selecting the right backup strategy and regularly testing the reliability of backups are essential to ensuring data security and recovery in any database system (Patterson, 2019).
