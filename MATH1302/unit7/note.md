## Math Assignment

1. In a hostel, there are around ‘n’ number of students (assume a number above 100 for n) with rooms categorized as triple, double, and single occupancy. Explain how you will represent the above data as a graph.

You need not create or share the graph but make sure to include justification for the below questions:

(i) Will the graph be a simple graph or a multigraph?

(ii) Will it have loops?

(iii) What is the possible maximum and minimum degree for each student?

 (iv) If all problems are represented in the form of graphs, won’t the problems be easily visualized and solved? (v)Can we represent every problem with a graph? Explain the reason by considering an example of a situation that has 11 vertices such that the degree of each vertex is 11.

2. A University is conducting a conference for two days on different subjects for students pursuing their higher education. Your task is to create a time slot scheduling model for the conference sessions (based on the subjects attended by students) using graph coloring. Draw the graph for the same and answer the chromatic number of this problem of scheduling time slots with the number of subjects your choice.

3. Explain Euler and Hamiltonian cycles, and provide one simple counter example for each. Find the Euler circuit/path and Hamiltonian cycle/path for the given graph G.

4. Explain the spanning tree. Find at least two possible spanning trees for the following graph H and explain how you determined that they are spanning trees. Draw a bipartite graph from any one of the two spanning trees that you found.
