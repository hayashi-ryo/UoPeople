1. Since the English course is a required subject, you need to choose the remaining two courses from the 10-1=9 available courses. As the order of selection does not matter, you can calculate it using the combination concept.
\[ \binom{10}{2} = \frac{10 \times 9}{2 \times 1} = 45 \]
Therefore, among the course combinations that cover the scholarship, there are 45 patterns where English is a required subject.

2. Consider two sets, A and B, as follows:
\[ A = \{1,2,3,4\} \]
\[ B = \{a,b,c\} \]
First, consider an injection (one-to-one function) from A to B. Since an injection must use all elements of A, but not necessarily all elements of B, the number of injection functions in this scenario is:
\[ 3^4 = 81 \]
Next, consider a surjection (onto function). In a surjection, all elements of B must be assigned as outputs. Therefore, the number of surjection functions in this scenario is the number of combinations to assign elements from A to each element of B:
\[ 4^3 = 64 \]

3. Perform calculations using the binomial theorem, organized by terms.
(i) \( x^{3}(x+2)^{10} \)
Since we need to multiply by \( x^{3} \), we only need to calculate the terms related to \( x^4 \) in \( (x+2)^{10} \).
\[ \binom{10}{6} \times 2^6 = 210 \times 64 = 13,440 \]
(ii) Since there is no term to multiply, use the binomial theorem directly.
\[ \binom{7}{0} \times x^7 \times 5^0 = 1 \]
Add (i) and (ii) to get the answer, which is 13,441.

4. Since order does not matter in this problem, you can use the concept of combinations. Consider cases with and without choosing the treasurer.
(i) To choose 7 people out of 30, calculate:
\[ \binom{30}{7} = 2,035,800 \]
(ii) As the treasurer is already chosen, consider choosing 6 people from the remaining 29. Therefore,
\[ \binom{29}{6} = 475,020 \]

5.1. A bit string is a representation of information using 0s and 1s. It is primarily used in computing, where each 0 and 1 is referred to as a bit. In computer systems, combinations of 0s and 1s are commonly used to represent data and instructions.
5.2. Consider a bit string with a weight of 3 for 8 digits as an example. Since the weight is 3, there must be 3 ones, and this can be calculated using combinations. For this example,
\[ \binom{8}{3} = 56 \]
So, there are 56 possible bit strings.
5.3. Consider a 3-digit number, such as 725. There are 3! = 6 permutations of these digits, but we want to find the number of transpositions where no element remains in its original position. This can be calculated using the inclusion-exclusion principle.
(i) Total number of 3-digit numbers: 6
(ii) At least one digit in its original position: 2 * 3 = 6
(iii) At least two digits in their original positions: 1 * 3 = 3
(iv) All digits in their original positions: 1
Calculate using the inclusion-exclusion principle: \(6 - 6 + 3 - 1 = 2\). Therefore, there are 2 transpositions of 725.
5.4.1. Since repetition is not allowed, consider choosing 4 numbers from 10 as a permutation. Since order matters for password requirements, use permutations:
\[ \text{10P4} = 5,040 \] possible passwords.
5.4.2. Since repetition is allowed, each of the 4 digits can be any of the 10 options. Therefore,
\[ 10^4 = 10,000 \] possible passwords.
