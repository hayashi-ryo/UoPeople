## Discussion Forum

- Part 1
  - You are organizing a swimming competition with ‘n’ participants. The school has announced scholarships for the top three swimmers. The details of the scholarship is as follows:
    1. First place - 100 % scholarship to study abroad
    2. Second-place - 100 % scholarship to study in any school all over the country
    3. Third-place – 50% scholarship to study in any school all over the country
  - Take ‘n’ as any two-digit number representing the total number of participants in the competition. Find how many possible ways are there to award these scholarships if there are no ties during the competition. Explain in detail.
- Part2
  - A group of n -school principals are trained for implementing innovative education in their schools. (Choose a two-digit number for n). As a part of the innovative education scheme, 9 schools are to be offered equal funds from the government.
    1. n how many ways can 9 schools be selected from the trained group?
    2. If your school is one among the 9 selected schools, how many ways will be left to choose the other schools?
- In both parts 1 and 2, which concepts are you using? Explain the reason to choose the concept. Also, discuss how combinatorics helps to solve real-world counting problems.

## Math Assignment

1. Imagine you received a scholarship that would cover only 3 courses out of the 11 courses related to your field of study at your university. How many ways will you have to choose the three courses and how many ways can you choose for the remaining two courses if one course- English (out of the 11 courses) is mandatory to take? Explain how you arrived at the answer.
2. Consider two sets A and B having cardinality of your choice. Explain how many injective and bijective functions are possible from set A to set B. Please avoid the examples given in textbooks or online resources and come up with your own unique example.
3. Find the coefficient of   x^{7}   in the expansion of   x^{3} (x+2)^{10} + (x+5)^{7}
4. A newly constructed apartment has 30 club members. The club has planned to create a sports committee consisting of 7 club members. How many different sports committees are possible? How many committees are possible if it is mandatory to have the selected treasurer of the club members in the sports committee? Explain in detail.
5. Answer the following questions:
   1. Explain bit string in your own words.
   2. Give an example of a bit string with any length and weight and explain how combinations help find the number of bit strings possible for the example.
   3. Choose a 3-digit number example and explain the number of derangements that can be formed from it.
   4. To create a 4 digit- password for your Android phone,
      1. How many ways are there to crack the password if no digit repeats?
      2. If the digits can be repeated, how many ways are there to crack the password?
