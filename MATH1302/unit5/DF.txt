Hello, classmates.
I will now explain my answers to the current question.

1. First, let me explain each logical operator.
v (OR): Represents logical disjunction. If either of two propositions is true, the entire proposition is true. For example, in the proposition "Witness A was at the crime scene v Witness B was at the crime scene," if either proposition is true, the overall claim is considered true.
Λ (AND): Represents logical conjunction. The entire proposition is true only if both propositions are true. For example, in the proposition "Surveillance camera footage shows suspect X Λ Physical evidence matches," the overall claim is true only if both propositions are true.
→ (IMPLICATION): Represents implication. If the premise is true, the conclusion is also true. For example, in the proposition "If the testimony is correct, the culprit is X," the conclusion is true only if the testimony is true.
↔ (BICONDITIONAL): Represents biconditional. The entire proposition is true if both propositions are either "both true" or "both false." For example, it indicates that "the testimony is true only if the culprit is X, and otherwise, the testimony is false."
¬ (NOT): Represents negation. It reverses the truth value of a proposition. For example, "the testimony is not true" means "the testimony is false."

Additionally, when parentheses are present in a proposition, as in mathematical calculations, the logical operations inside the parentheses are evaluated first. For instance, in the proposition (P ∧ Q) ∨ R, P ∧ Q is evaluated first, followed by the evaluation of ∨ R.
I have created an example using these logical operators:
Proposition: (P→Q)Λ(¬R↔S)
Let me explain this proposition:
P→Q: If a detective finds specific evidence P, the conclusion Q is deduced. This is a conditional proposition.
¬R↔S: The absence of evidence R is equivalent to the occurrence of a specific situation S. This is a logical biconditional.
The logical operator Λ is used to require that these conditions hold simultaneously.

2. Consider the conditional proposition "If the victim is in a specific location, the perpetrator is nearby."
Proposition (P): The victim is in a specific location.
Proposition (Q): The perpetrator is nearby.
In this case, the contrapositive, inverse, and converse are as follows:
Converse: If the perpetrator is not nearby, the victim is not in the specific location. Symbolically, it is represented as ¬Q→¬P. Since one might still consider the possibility of the perpetrator being near even if the original proposition is true, the logic in this case is flawed.
Contrapositive: If the perpetrator is nearby, the victim is in the specific location. Symbolically, it is represented as Q→P. This logic is flawed because the presence of the perpetrator nearby does not guarantee the victim's presence in the specific location.
Inverse: If the victim is not in the specific location, the perpetrator is not nearby. Symbolically, it is represented as ¬P→¬Q. However, even if the victim is not in the specific location, it does not necessarily mean that the perpetrator is not nearby. Therefore, this logic is not valid.
