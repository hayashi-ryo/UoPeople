1. A recursive function is a function defined by calling itself. A typical example is a recursive function that calculates factorial. Factorial, denoted as n! for a non-negative integer n, is the product of all integers from 1 to n.
Here's the definition of the factorial recursive function:

\[ f(n) = n \times f(n-1) \]
\[ f(0) = 1 \]

In this recursive function, the base case (when n is 0) and the recursive step (when n is not 0) are defined. The base case serves as the condition to end the recursion, and the recursive step is the part where the function calls itself.
For example, calculating `f(5)` proceeds as follows:

\[ f(5) = 5 \times f(4) \]
\[ f(5) = 5 \times 4 \times f(3) \]
\[ f(5) = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times f(2) \]
\[ f(5) = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times f(1) \]
\[ f(5) = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times f(0) \]
\[ f(5) = 5 \times 4 \times 3 \times 2 \times 1 \times 1 \]
This demonstrates how factorials are calculated recursively, breaking the problem into smaller subproblems and solving them.

a) The recursive relation representing the number of washing machines manufactured by a company in the first n months is as follows:
\[ a_n = a_{n-1} + n \]
Here, \( a_n \) represents the number of washing machines produced in the nth month.

b) The total number of washing machines manufactured by the company in the first year is obtained by summing the numbers for the first 12 months. Mathematically, it is expressed as:
\[ a_{\text{year}} = a_1 + a_2 + \ldots + a_{12} \]
Calculating this sum gives the answer, which is 78.

c) The explicit formula for the number of washing machines produced by the company in the first n months can be derived by solving the recursive relation mentioned earlier. The specific steps are as follows:

The original recursive relation is as follows:

\[ a_n = a_{n-1} + n \]

Here, the initial condition is \( a_1 = 1 \).

Steps:

1. **Substitute the Initial Condition**: For the case when \( n = 1 \), substitute the initial condition \( a_1 = 1 \).
   \[ a_1 = 1 \]

2. **Apply the Recursive Relation**: Apply the recursive relation \( a_n = a_{n-1} + n \).
   \[ a_2 = a_1 + 2 \]
   \[ a_3 = a_2 + 3 \]
   \[ \vdots \]
   \[ a_n = a_{n-1} + n \]

3. **Simplify the Expression**: Simplify these expressions by combining some terms.
   \[ a_2 = 1 + 2 \]
   \[ a_3 = (1 + 2) + 3 \]
   \[ a_4 = ((1 + 2) + 3) + 4 \]
   \[ \vdots \]
   In concise form, this can be expressed as:
   \[ a_n = 1 + 2 + 3 + \ldots + n \]

4. **Apply the Formula for the Sum of an Arithmetic Series**: The sum of such a series can be calculated using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, which is:
   \[ S = \frac{n}{2}(a_1 + a_n) \]
   Here, \( S \) is the sum, \( n \) is the number of terms, \( a_1 \) is the first term, and \( a_n \) is the last term.
   In this case, \( a_1 = 1 \) and \( a_n = n \), so
   \[ a_n = \frac{n}{2}(1 + n) \]

This yields the explicit formula representing the number of washing machines produced by the company in the first n months.
