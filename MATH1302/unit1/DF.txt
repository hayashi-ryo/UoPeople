Hello, classmates.
For this question, I was conscious of adding duplicate elements to the created set because various operations on sets were required. Here is my example for this time:
\[A = \{10,100,1000,10000\}\]
\[B = \{100,200,1000,2000\}\]
\[U = \{10,100,1000,10000,100,200,1000,2000,abc,def,ghi\}\]

I will answer each question.

i. \(A \cup B\)
\[A \cup B = \{10,100,1000,10000,200,2000\}\]

ii. \(A \cap B\)
\[A \cap B = \{100, 1000\}\]

iii. \((A \cap B) \cup U\)
\[(A \cap B) \cup U = \{10,100,1000,10000,100,200,1000,2000,abc,def,ghi\}\]

iv. The Power set of \(A\).
The power set of a set includes all subsets of the set. If the original set has n elements, there are \(2^n\) subsets. In my example, since the number of elements is 4, there are \(2^4 = 16\) subsets.
\[P(A) = \{\},\{10\},\{100\},\{1000\},\{10000\},\{10,100\},\{10,1000\},\{10,10000\},\{100,1000\},\{100,10000\},\{1000,10000\},\{10,100,1000\},\{10,100,10000\},\{10,1000,10000\},\{100,1000,10000\},\{10,100,1000,10000\}\]

v. \(A'\)
\[A'\] is the complement of \(A\) taken from the universal set \(U\).
\[A' = U - A = \{200,2000,abc,def,ghi\}\]

vi. \(\emptyset \cap B\)
\(\emptyset\) is the symbol representing the empty set. Since the empty set does not contain any elements, the intersection operation with any set results in the empty set.
\(\emptyset \cap B = \emptyset\)

vii. \(A \times B\)
The Cartesian product of sets includes all possible combinations of elements from each set. The result is as follows:
\[A \times B = \{(10,100),(10,200),(10,1000),(10,2000),(100,100),(100,200),(100,1000),(100,2000),(1000,100),(1000,200),(1000,1000),(1000,2000),(10000,100),(10000,200),(10000,1000),(10000,2000)\}\]

viii. \(A - B\)
The operation of removing elements of \(B\) from \(A\) results in the following:
\[A - B = \{10,10000\}\]

ix. \((A - B) \cup (B - A)\)
Since \(A - B = \{10,10000\}\) and \(B - A = \{200,2000\}\), the union is \(\{10, 200, 2000, 10000\}\).

x. Prove any one De Morgan identity for \(A\) and \(B\).
De Morgan's laws for sets are rules regarding complements. Specifically, for two sets \(A\) and \(B\), the laws are as follows:
\[(A \cup B)' = A' \cap B'\]
\[(A \cap B)' = A' \cup B'\]
Let's prove the first law for this example.
First, calculate \(A \cup B\):
\[A \cup B = \{10,100,1000,10000,200,2000\}\]
Take the complement:
\[(A \cup B)' = U - (A \cup B) = \{abc,def,ghi\}\] ...(1)
Next, consider the complements of sets \(A\) and \(B\):
\[A' = \{200,2000,abc,def,ghi\}\]
\[B' = \{10,10000,abc,def,ghi\}\]
Calculate \(A' \cap B'\):
\[A' \cap B' = \{abc,def,ghi\}\] ...(2)
The equality of (1) and (2) has been proven.
