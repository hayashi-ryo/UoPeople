1.
(a) \(A \cap B\) represents the set of individuals who have joined the company and specifically joined the IT department. In other words, it refers to set A.
(b) \(A \cup B\) Since \(A \subseteq B\), this result refers to set B.
(c) \(A - B\) Since \(A \subseteq B\), performing this operation requires removing all elements of A, which is represented by Ø.
(d) \(B - A\) represents the set of individuals who have joined the company but not in the IT department.

2. 
(a) The set of people living in the USA and having a house in Canada:
\[A \cap B\]

(b) The set of people living in the USA who are not having a house in Canada:
\[A - (A \cap B)\]
This can also be expressed as \(A \cap B'\), where \(B'\) represents the complement of set B.

(c) The set of people who either live in the USA or have a house in Canada:
\[A \cup B\]

(d) The set of people who are either non-US residents or do not own a house in Canada:
\[(A') \cup (B')\]
This set represents the union of the complement of set A (non-US residents) and the complement of set B (people who do not own a house in Canada).

3.
Using the principles of inclusion and exclusion, we will calculate the number of employees in the company. First, we organize the number of employees receiving each benefit.
Number of employees receiving taxi benefits: 750 ...(a)
Number of employees receiving breakfast benefits: 900 ...(b)
Number of employees receiving both benefits: 530 ...(c)
Number of employees receiving none of the benefits: 60 ...(d)
Using this information and the principles of inclusion and exclusion, we calculate the total number of employees.

Total number of employees = Taxi benefit count(a) + Breakfast benefit count(b) - Both benefits count(c) + Number of employees receiving neither(d)
→
Total number of employees = 750 + 900 - 530 + 60
= 1180

Therefore, the total number of employees in this company is 1180.
