To get the qualification of UoPeople, I make chat diary.

## Chat Diary

1. Did you have fun today?
   1. I'm working on a job that I will be implemented by myself. It is so excited for me. I want to keep it going.
   2. I went to see a band from the U.S. I used to listen their music every day when I was at school, and listening to them took me back to those happy days.

2. Where is your favorite place?
   1. My favorite spot is the home electricity store. There are so many things that I have not watched ever, and it is so excited for me.
   2. My own bed of course! Is the any better place? It's like being in heaven when I dive into my bed after a long day. I sometimes wish I could stay there forever.
