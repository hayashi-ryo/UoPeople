Hello classmates, This week, I will share my personal experiences regarding the cultural and gender social norms we studied in this unit.

In the environment where I grew up, gender conditioning was quite prevalent. For example, boys were expected to be physically strong and were often placed in more demanding situations. Additionally, cultural activities were seen as feminine, while sports and other physical activities were considered masculine. Because of this, I accepted these gender norms as a standard for my own behavior.
In the past, I did not question these social norms and naturally behaved within this framework. For instance, I participated actively in sports rather than cultural activities, leading a life focused on physical strength. This influenced my health-related beliefs and behaviors, ensuring that I regularly exercised to maintain my physical fitness.
Currently, I still feel the impact of this gender conditioning on my personal choices. However, I no longer impose these attitudes on others. I respect the choices and actions of individuals within the community, supporting their freedom regardless of gender. Compared to the content we studied in the text, I believe my health beliefs and behaviors still tend toward gender norms. Nevertheless, as society moves towards embracing diversity, I find myself changing under this influence.

Question: How can we transform the ethical standards formed by gender conditioning?
