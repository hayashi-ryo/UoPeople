## Discussion Forum

Think about the gender conditioning and the social norms of the culture where you lived during your childhood formative years. Consider the influence of gender conditioning on your health beliefs, health-related behaviors, and help-seeking behaviors.  Explain how gender conditioning and social norms you experienced during your formative years affected your health-related beliefs and behaviors both then and now. Compare this with the ideas in the readings and discuss whether your health beliefs and behaviors tend toward the gender norms or whether your health beliefs and behaviors tend to be one of the many exceptions.
End your discussion post with a question related to this unit for further discussion.
Your Discussion should be at least 150 words in length but not more than 300 words. When you use an informational source, such as the textbook, be sure to credit your source. You should continue to practice using APA format for citations and references.

## Written Assignment

The textbook and video highlighted differences in illness and symptoms for males and females. There are also differences in health outcomes, with females on average living longer than males. Describe at least 3-4 of the potential explanations for these differences. The textbook lists several examples on pages 86-90. Make sure to use your own words to share these ideas and include APA citations. Example: (Ogden, 2019). Which potential explanation is the most likely to account for differences in longevity between females and males and why?
The Written Assignment should be between 500 and 700 words. Your paper should be double-spaced. Make sure your assignment is using Microsoft Word (or a similar word processing application), Times New Roman, 12-point font, and 1” margins. Please do not submit a PDF document. All papers must be able to be opened with Microsoft Word. You can get assistance with APA formatting in the Learning Resource Center.

Papers will be assessed using the following criteria:

- Student described at least 3 different potential explanations for differences between male and female health
- Student used their own words to explain the ideas used in their paper
- Student used the textbook to support the ideas in their paper
- Student included at least one other source (article, book, website) to support their paper
- Student practiced in text citations. {For example: (author, year) (Ogden, 2019)} These are found within the paper to give credit for ideas to the author.
- Paper is between 500 and 700 words, not including the title and reference pages
- All references cited in APA format, with a source list
- Paper professionally written without spelling or grammar errors

## Learning Journal

As you reflect on the ideas presented this week, how do you think that common gender stereotypes could negatively affect patients in health care settings? In psychology, it is assumed that everyone has some biases. Consider your own biases and whether they could potentially affect your treatment of others. What strategies could be used to counteract these biases? Include hypothetical examples and/or personal examples if applicable.
The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 300 words and not more than 500 words. Use APA citations and references when you use ideas from the readings or other sources.
