Hello classmates,
I would like to share my experience with asthma and how it impacted my quality of life (QOL).
I have had asthma since childhood, and its symptoms significantly affected my quality of life. Especially during periods when asthma attacks were frequent, I often experienced nighttime attacks that prevented me from getting enough sleep. This lack of sleep made it difficult to fully recover my strength.
For asthma treatment, I needed to use inhalers regularly, which came with some side effects. Specifically, using steroid medications lowered my immune system, making me more susceptible to catching colds. Additionally, sudden nighttime attacks meant I had to prepare medication and often disturbed my family with my coughing.
Since around the age of 15, I have not had any asthma attacks. This turning point allowed me to travel and sleep without worrying about attacks, significantly improving my QOL. Chronic diseases like asthma can greatly impact QOL, especially when unpredictable attacks constantly occupy your thoughts, leading to mental fatigue. Now that I no longer have to worry about asthma, I feel a marked improvement in my QOL.

Lastly, I have a question: How should psychological support be provided to children with chronic illnesses?
