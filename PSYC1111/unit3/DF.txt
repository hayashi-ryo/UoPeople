Hello classmates.
I would like to explain, based on my own experience, the theory we learned about in this week's unit to promote behavior change.

As an example of a health behavior change I have tackled, I will discuss my experience with dieting. The catalyst for starting my diet was a remark from a parent I hadn't seen in a while. To ensure sustained success, I implemented the following strategies: daily weight tracking, averaging weekly caloric balance, recording meals, and sharing my progress with others. These efforts led to success, especially recording my meals, which provided a good opportunity to realize my unconscious overeating. Additionally, sharing my progress helped prevent stagnation and rebounding.
The "Social Cognition Theory and the Use of Planning" we studied this week is highly relevant to my dieting experience. This theory explains that setting SMART goals, measuring daily progress, and sharing information with others can enhance behavioral changes. These elements were crucial in my dieting success.
Had I known this theory beforehand, I might have approached my goals more efficiently. Moving forward, I intend to apply this learning not only to my studies at UoPeople but also to achieve other goals.

Question: What are your thoughts on the impact of feedback from others on behavior change in health psychology?
