## Discussion Forum

Share an intentional health-related behavior change that you have made in the past (it is ok if it wasn’t maintained long term). Did your personal experience relate to any of the ideas or theories in the readings or videos this week? Explain the idea or theory briefly along with your experience related to the idea or theory, and be sure to identify which reading your idea/theory came from. Do you feel that knowing any of these past ideas or theories would help you get through the behavior change? If so, please share your thoughts on that as well.
End your discussion post with one well-thought-out question related to health psychology from which your colleagues can formulate a response or generate further discussion.

Your Discussion should be at least 150 words in length but not more than 300 words. When you use an informational source, such as the textbook, be sure to share the link to the source you used.

## Learning Journal

Consider population-level interventions that aim to achieve health-related behavior change (mass media, financial incentives, etc.) along with everything you learned this week about behavior change. What do you think would be the most effective plan or method for improving health-related behavior at the population level? Write your recommendations along with your reasoning supported by at least one of the readings. Feel free to also include your own innovative ideas for achieving population-level health.  

The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 300 words and not more than 500 words. If you use an informational source, be sure to identify the source and share the link to the source you used.
