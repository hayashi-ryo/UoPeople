Hello classmates,

In this session, we learned about several models that explain and predict health behaviors, and I would like to share my understanding.

According to the text, in the Health Belief Model, whether an individual engages in a specific health behavior depends on whether they feel that the behavior will result in important outcomes for them or if they perceive benefits from the action. For example, consider vaccinations against various diseases. In my country, the vaccination rate among people living their normal lives is not very high. However, the vaccination rate increases in the following situations:

1. Important timing: At critical times such as university entrance exams, getting sick can be a significant disadvantage. In such cases, the health behavior of getting vaccinated becomes a major benefit compared to not taking action, thus increasing the vaccination rate.
2. When a serious disease is prevalent: During an outbreak of a serious disease like the coronavirus, getting the disease itself can be a major disadvantage. Additionally, when little is known about the long-term effects, the proportion of people taking the health action of getting vaccinated increases.
3. Clear benefits of vaccination: There are cases where specific health behaviors like vaccinations bring financial and time benefits. Subsidies for vaccinated travelers or travel restrictions to other countries are examples. In these situations, the substantial benefits of vaccination make it more likely that people will choose to act.

Thus, analyzing the relationship between specific health behaviors and individual beliefs is extremely important.

Health psychology-related question: How does cultural background influence health behavior models? Additionally, what are the advantages of understanding different cultural backgrounds and their impact on health behaviors?
