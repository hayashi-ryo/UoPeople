In Japan, where I live, sleep deprivation is widely recognized as a significant health issue. The prevailing work culture of long hours means many people are unable to secure the necessary sleep. This environment adversely affects both mental and physical aspects, leading to decreased productivity and a reduced quality of life.
Generally, Japanese people understand that sleep deprivation negatively impacts both mental and physical health. However, due to the following reasons, many still fail to get enough sleep:
Social pressure in the workplace: In Japan, it is common to work long hours and start work at a fixed time in the morning. This expectation often leads to a lifestyle where people sleep late and wake up early, prioritizing work participation over sufficient sleep.
The prevalence of entertainment options like smartphones: The widespread availability of smartphones and PC games, which provide easily accessible entertainment for extended periods, often leads individuals to choose short-term enjoyment over sufficient sleep, despite being aware of the disadvantages of sleep deprivation.
My own beliefs were initially in line with the typical views in Japanese society. However, as I began to experience significant drawbacks from sleep deprivation, such as decreased work performance and reduced vitality for active pursuits, I made it a priority to establish a fixed sleep schedule. While I still occasionally cut back on sleep, I am now able to get more rest than before.
Reflecting on the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) that I studied this week, I have come to understand the threats posed by unhealthy behaviors like sleep deprivation more deeply. By applying this theory, I was able to initiate efforts to remove barriers to improving my health, specifically by improving my sleep habits. This approach is applicable to other health behaviors that need improvement. Therefore, by utilizing the Theory of Planned Behavior, I plan to continue improving health behaviors. This method is expected to help maintain and enhance my health further.
