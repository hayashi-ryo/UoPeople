Introduction

In recent years, the prevalence of busy lifestyles and various digital devices has made securing quality sleep increasingly challenging. Insufficient sleep is widely recognized to have numerous detrimental effects on physical and mental health, making its resolution a critical public health issue. This paper analyzes the unhealthy behavior of sleep deprivation and explores how it is related to individual health beliefs. Using the Stages of Change Model, the Health Belief Model (HBM), and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the analysis will examine how sleep deprivation is perceived and the psychosocial factors that influence this behavior in detail.

Stages of Change Model
This model illustrates the process by which individuals change unhealthy behaviors in a step-by-step manner. Below is an analysis related to sleep deprivation:
Precontemplation: Individuals do not recognize that their lack of sleep is a problem. They underestimate the risks associated with sleep deprivation and have no motivation to change their behavior.
Contemplation: Individuals begin to notice the potential health impacts of sleep deprivation and consider the possibility of changing their behavior.
Preparation: Individuals make concrete improvement plans and prepare to initiate healthy behaviors. At this stage, they recognize that behavior change will have a beneficial effect on their health.
Action: Individuals improve their sleep patterns and implement health behaviors such as maintaining a consistent bedtime.
Maintenance: Improved sleep habits are continued, and new healthy behaviors are sustained without reverting to old habits.
Regarding sleep deprivation, many are stuck in the contemplation stage without adequately recognizing the risks, preventing them from moving to the preparation stage. In such cases, societal actions aimed at properly recognizing the risks of sleep deprivation need to be implemented.

Health Belief Model (HBM)
This model predicts that the execution of health behaviors is based on the evaluation of perceived threats and the benefits and barriers:
Perceived Susceptibility and Severity: Whether individuals view the health risks caused by sleep deprivation as significant or underestimate them.
Perceived Benefits: The benefits of quality sleep to health are widely recognized.
Perceived Barriers: Factors such as work and smartphones are inhibiting the improvement of sleep habits.
According to the Health Belief Model, insufficient risk perception of sleep deprivation makes it difficult to take action to remove barriers.

Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)
This theory posits that the intention to behave is formed by attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control:
Attitude: There is a positive recognition towards adopting healthy sleep habits.
Subjective Norms: There is little social expectation to adopt healthy sleep habits.
Perceived Behavioral Control: Particularly due to work, time management is difficult, making behavioral control challenging.

Conclusion

This paper analyzed the widespread health issue of sleep deprivation using the Stages of Change Model, the Health Belief Model (HBM), and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB). Through these models, we have detailed how sleep deprivation is linked to individual health beliefs and unveiled the psychosocial factors influencing behavior.
The Stages of Change Model revealed that many individuals do not recognize the risks associated with sleep deprivation or are unprepared to change their behavior. The Health Belief Model highlighted the underestimation of sleep deprivation risks and how life's barriers obstruct efforts to engage in healthy behaviors. Meanwhile, the Theory of Planned Behavior emphasized the need for enhanced societal support and awareness of personal behavioral control.
Based on these insights, effective intervention strategies require a multifaceted approach. Public health campaigns should focus on educating and raising awareness about the importance of sleep and its impact on health. Additionally, improving health policies in workplaces and schools to foster environments that promote better sleep is crucial. Moreover, revising technology use and setting specific guidelines to reduce sleep-disrupting factors is desirable.
Finally, developing customized support programs tailored to individual environments and capabilities is necessary. This will enable individuals to manage their behaviors more effectively and maintain healthy sleep habits long-term. Sleep is a fundamental health component for everyone, and improving it is key to enhancing the quality of life and forming a healthier society.
