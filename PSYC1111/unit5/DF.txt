Hello everyone. Based on my personal experiences, I would like to discuss the stress management techniques we learned about in this week's unit.

I determine my coping strategies based on whether the issue is within my control. For controllable problems, I actively seek solutions. On the other hand, when situations are beyond my control, I make a conscious effort to manage my emotions and not get overwhelmed.

For instance, I was worried about completing a project on time at work, feeling that we were short on both time and manpower. In response to this, I focused on eliminating the anxiety and haste brought about by the fear of 'failure.' Ultimately, while the project was delayed, it was successfully completed. Making a decision not to be swayed by emotions was a good choice. This is a classic example of using emotion-focused coping.

From this experience, I reaffirmed that stress management is an essential element of a healthy lifestyle. Particularly, assessing whether a situation is controllable and choosing the appropriate coping strategy is crucial for maintaining psychological health. I believe this skill is universally applicable and beneficial to many people.
