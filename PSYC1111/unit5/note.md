## Discussion Forum

After completing the readings, think of a time when you were under stress, and you used problem-focused coping and/or emotion-focused coping. Explain the situation and discuss how your coping strategies affected your health.  Also, consider approach vs. avoidance coping in the context of stress related to illness.
Share at least one idea for improving coping skills (or resilience) in those who are experiencing illness.  
Your Discussion should be at least 150 words in length but not more than 300 words. When you use an informational source, such as the textbook, be sure to credit your source. This is a good time to start practicing some of what you learned about APA in UNIV 1001!

## Written Assignment

Write about psychological influences on pain perception. Specifically discuss the Gate Control Theory of Pain by Melzack and Wall (1965), analyzing factors that can open the gate and factors that can close the gate. Consider this in relation to the reading by Tsai et al. (2018), on the positive effects of blogging about chronic pain and illness. Discuss blogging in the context of psychological moderators such as stress, coping, social support, control, and personality. When you discuss information from a reading resource, be sure to identify the reading you are using.
When you use an informational source, such as the textbook, be sure to share the link to the source you used. This is a good time to start practicing some of what you learned about APA in UNIV 1001.
The Written Assignment should be between 500 and 700 words. Your paper should be double-spaced. Make sure your assignment is using Microsoft Word (or a similar word processing application), Times New Roman, 12-point font, and 1” margins. Please do not submit a PDF document. All papers must be able to be opened with Microsoft Word.  

## Learning Journal

As you consider what you’ve learned about pain and stress this week, write about one theory you found especially interesting (either from the textbook or one of the articles). Include examples of how this theory could be applied to potentially improve your health or help someone in your family or circle of friends. Also, include ideas about how this theory could potentially be applied to improve health at the community level.  
The Learning Journal entry should be a minimum of 300 words and not more than 500 words. If you use an informational source, be sure to identify the source and share the link to the source you used. This is a good time to start practicing some of what you learned about APA in UNIV 1001.
