Hello classmates.
I would like to explain my views on this topic.

1. What is distributive justice?
According to Velasquez, distributive justice is a form of justice that deals with the fair distribution of resources, opportunities, and benefits in society. Various approaches and theories are considered to achieve fair distribution, and the principles emphasized may vary depending on the method. However, generally, there are four principles:

Equality: Resources are distributed equally among all members of society, regardless of individual characteristics or contributions.
Need: Distribution should be based on individual needs, prioritizing those who are more in need.
Utility: Distribution is based on individual abilities and efforts.
Contribution: Distribution is based on the individual's contribution to society.

2. In chapter 2 of Business Ethics, read the case study named, "Three Forms of Justice". Based on that case study, answer the following question: When people debate distributive justice today, what concerns do they raise about it?

When discussing distributive justice, concerns may arise depending on which principle is emphasized as the core of the system. Here are some examples:

Fair Distribution: How resources and benefits are distributed is a significant concern. Regardless of the distribution method, there is a possibility of resulting in unequal outcomes.
Fairness vs. Equality: The central debate revolves around whether resources and benefits should be distributed fairly or directed more towards those in greater need. Given that members on either side may face substantial disadvantages, it is crucial to emphasize the purpose of the system.
Conflict between Utilitarian/Contribution-based and Need-based Principles: There is a conflict between the utilitarian/contribution-based approach that advocates distribution based on outcomes and efforts and the need-based approach that advocates distribution based on necessity.
Limits of Distributable Resources: Resources and benefits in society may be limited. Therefore, preferences for certain members may result in unfair outcomes for others.
