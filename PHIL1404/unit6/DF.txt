Hello classmates.
Let me explain my response to this topic.

1. I believe that companies have an ethical obligation to find a balance between maintaining profits and paying a fair living wage. I will explain three reasons.
Social Responsibility: I believe that companies should be responsible for the welfare of their employees, customers, and the entire Tami-related community. Paying employees a fair living wage is an important part of that social responsibility.
Sustainability: In the long run, stable livelihoods for employees will help companies sustain stable growth by improving labor productivity and preventing talent loss.
Fair competition: by ensuring that all firms pay fair wages. I believe that this will prevent distortion of competition due to unfairly low wages.

2. Fair wages are difficult to factor into a single element because of the wide variety of information involved. First, let us discuss the factors that influence it
Government and Law: In many countries, governments set minimum wages. This represents the minimum wage an employee should receive and is legally protected.
Labor market supply and demand: The balance between supply and demand for labor by occupation and region has a significant impact on wage levels. Occupations that require specialized skills and areas with a smaller labor force tend to pay higher wages.
Negotiate with labor unions: Labor unions negotiate to improve wages and working conditions for employees in their industries and companies. This is an important factor affecting wage levels.
Industry Standards and Competition: Competition from other companies in the same industry also affects wage levels. Firms need to match industry standards and competitors' wage levels to attract and retain the best talent.
Cost of Living: Regional differences in cost of living are also a consideration. Regions with a higher cost of living may require higher wages.
I believe that two of the most important factors described are industry standards and competition and the cost of living. I believe that these two are the two areas that are affected by the principles of the market economy.

3. It is important for the board to explain how the decision will benefit the company. I will explain four of the contents.
Increased employee motivation and productivity: When employees feel they are fairly compensated for their work, they are more motivated to do their jobs. This can directly translate into increased productivity, which in turn can have a positive impact on the company's bottom line.
Improved recruitment and retention: In a competitive labor market, higher wages attract the best talent and provide an incentive for them to stay longer. This can lead to lower recruitment costs and a more stable workforce.
Improved corporate image and brand value: A reputation as a socially responsible company increases customer and investor confidence and ultimately improves the value of the company's brand.
Reduced risk: Paying more than the legal minimum wage minimizes the impact of future legal or policy changes. Employee financial stability also reduces problems and disputes in the workplace.
