The modern labor market demands new approaches to how organizations operate and how employees are hired. Job sharing can be a viable option for companies and employees in these rapidly changing times. In this issue, I will explore the impact of job sharing on the company, its customers, and its employees, and discuss the results comprehensively.


1. What points support the job-sharing plan? How would it benefit the company? The employees?
I consider the benefits of job sharing from the perspective of both the company and the employee.
Benefits to the Company
Cost savings: Since part-time employees do not have to be offered benefits, companies can reduce costs such as health insurance and loans.
Increased flexibility: Hiring part-time employees makes it easier to adjust the workforce based on business conditions and respond quickly to fluctuations in demand.
A more diverse workforce: The possibility of hiring a more diverse workforce by allowing the company to hire people with skills and experience that would not be available for full-time work.
Benefits to Employees
Ease of Work: Part-time work can improve the balance between work and personal life by making it easier to balance work with family and other tasks.
Opportunity: Job sharing can be a way to provide employment opportunities for more people.

2. What negative effects might it have on the company and the employees?
I consider the disadvantages of job sharing from the perspective of both the company and the employee.
Disadvantages for the company
Lack of continuity of work: Having multiple part-time employees share the same tasks can lead to inconsistent work and make quality control more difficult.
Increased training costs: Teacher/training costs increase because more employees must be hired as part-timers
Lack of employee motivation: A work environment that does not provide benefits can decrease employee motivation.
Disadvantages for Employees
Lack of benefits: Part-time employees are not offered benefits, which reduces financial stability and security for the future.
Reduced career growth opportunities: Limited career advancement opportunities may make long-term professional and skill development difficult.
Work/life balance: While job sharing offers flexibility, irregular work hours and income insecurity can impact family life.

3. Do you have any concerns about potential employment discrimination if this plan is implemented? If so, what would they be?
Consider concerns about potential employment discrimination when implementing job sharing. I lost three in terms of stability, age, and other factors.
Gender-based discrimination: Gender discrimination issues may arise when gender-based biases or stereotypes are at play, such as assigning a female employee to a part-time position for childcare or other reasons.
Discrimination Against People with Disabilities: Issues of discrimination based on disability may arise, such as not assigning full-time positions to employees with disabilities and limiting them to part-time positions.
Discrimination based on economic status: This could create inequalities based on current economic status, such as assigning part-time positions to economically insecure people, rather than assigning them stable, full-time positions.

4. Is creating job-sharing positions the right thing for the company/customers/employees to do in this situation?
To determine whether creating a job-sharing position is the right thing to do for each of the company, customers, and employees, it is necessary to analyze the situation from the perspective of each.
From the company's perspective: In the short term, job sharing may lead to cost savings and increased workforce flexibility. However, in the long term, it may cause operational problems, such as reduced employee motivation and lower work quality. These tradeoffs should be considered before deciding whether to implement a position.
Customer Perspective: The customer's position may be to demand consistency in product quality and service. Job sharing can have both positive and negative effects on these factors, so you need to consider what objectives you are trying to achieve by implementing job sharing.
Employee perspective: Job sharing may improve the balance between work and personal life. However, it also comes with disadvantages, such as reduced benefits and limited opportunities for career growth. From the employee's perspective, being able to choose it as an option without being forced to do so could be very beneficial.
In conclusion, assigning employees to part-time positions for short-term cost savings, as in this case, can be problematic from the standpoint of reduced motivation and additional costs. If implemented, I believe the following aspects should be considered
If existing key employees are to be assigned to part-time positions, they should be able to choose to do so, rather than being ordered to do so by the company.
The company should be able to clearly state what kind of duties are required of the part-time position.

conclusion
While job sharing offers a wide variety of benefits, its disadvantages, and potential problems cannot be ignored. From the perspective of the company, the customer, and the employee, the short-term benefits and long-term impacts must be carefully weighed. Job sharing may be an effective strategy only if it is offered as an option to employees and is consistent with their needs and career goals. Ultimately, job sharing should be implemented in a manner that is consistent with the culture, goals, and welfare of the company and its employees. This will allow us to find a sustainable solution that is positive for all parties involved.
