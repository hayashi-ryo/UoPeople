Hello classmates.
I will explain my position on this question.

1. In the financial services industry, employers need to establish a strict code of conduct because information leaks and system failures are highly likely to become serious incidents. However, from the employee's perspective, it is difficult for them to act autonomously unless psychological safety is maintained as they proceed with their work. Therefore, the following mechanisms were considered as a means of ensuring psychological safety while conducting work.
Regular training and education: Employers should provide ongoing training and education programs to ensure that employees are fully familiar with the latest legal and ethical standards in the financial industry.
Clear Code of Conduct: Employers should develop a clear code of conduct, clearly stating ethical boundaries and emphasizing the importance of fiduciary duty.
Whistleblower Protection: Implementing a strong whistleblower protection program will encourage employees to report misconduct without fear of retaliation. This can serve as an internal defense against misconduct.
Independent Auditors: Regular independent audits and monitoring by compliance officers can help ensure that employees are adhering to ethical standards.
2. It is more likely today than in the 1980s to be treated with the consequences for insider trading and violations of fiduciary duty. Regulators and audit committees are more vigilant in their oversight and are cracking down on fraud in the financial markets. Fines and penalties are also likely to be more robust, providing a stronger deterrent. Furthermore, due to the popularity of social networking sites and other factors, the image of a company when fraud is discovered is likely to take a greater hit than it did in the 1980s.
3. I believe that receiving ethical certification from a public agency, such as a state, or a highly professional organization, will lead to higher ethical standards among employees. The reasons are listed below.
Standardization: Ethical accreditation from a credible source can establish ethical principles to be followed throughout the industry and promote a uniform ethical culture.
Business development: certification programs may include continuing education, which can ensure that professionals have up-to-date knowledge of ethical standards and best practices in the industry.
Public Confidence: Ethical certification can improve public confidence in the financial industry by demonstrating a commitment to integrity and responsible behavior.
