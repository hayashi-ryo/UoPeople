Hello classmates.
Let me explain my response to this topic.

1. labels may be checked for several reasons. I will explain the reasons.
Economic support of the region of manufacture: I find some items attractive if the country of manufacture listed on the label is my own country. This is because I feel that the consumption and use of products made in my country can have a small positive impact on the economy of my community.
Working conditions: If I hear on the news that a clothing company is taking unfair advantage of employees in a certain region, I will check the label of the clothing company to see where it is manufactured. If it is in an area where they may be suspected of taking unfair advantage of their employees, they may decide not to buy from them.
Of course, there are times when materials and price are the most important factors in making a choice, rather than checking the label, but these are the reasons I may be concerned myself.
2. The "country of manufacture is the U.S." does not seem attractive to me, to be honest. If the country of manufacture is in an area where I live or have a connection, I may increase my likelihood of purchasing the product as explained in No. 1. For other regions, the brand image is more likely to be more attractive than the country of manufacture label.
3. I imagined a situation where factory workers are treated unfairly, such as when proper safety regulations are not in place or when they are forced to work. Therefore, I came up with the idea of "setting industry standards" to ensure that they are treated fairly. This is intended to prevent harsh working conditions, etc., by establishing common social responsibilities and minimum standards across the industry in cooperation with other companies in the same industry and locally affiliated companies. I also believe that setting industry standards will increase the likelihood that fair and equitable practices will be introduced, even in the face of competition.
