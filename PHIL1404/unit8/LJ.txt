1. Do you believe Unilever sponsors the Shakti program to help women, to boost its own profits, or both? Explain your answer.
I believe that Unilever's reasons for supporting Project Shakti go both ways. Because I believe that Unilever has improved the company's bottom line by ensuring a strong commitment to the work vehicle. I will explain each of these reasons.
First, let's discuss the aspect of supporting women. The program provides social benefits by offering women the opportunity for economic independence and raising their self-esteem and social status. The fact that the program teaches local women the skills to run small businesses and provides them with the opportunity to earn an income as independent micro-entrepreneurs demonstrates that Unilever is aligned with its mission to improve women's livelihoods.
At the same time, Unilever enjoys the economic benefits of expanding its product distribution network and accessing untapped markets through this program. By allowing women to retail Unilever products, the company is able to reach new customer segments and increase product sales. In this way, Project Shakti is an example of linking social responsibility and business interests and serves as part of Unilever's social corporate responsibility (CSR) strategy.

2. If Unilever has mixed motives, does this discredit the company in your eyes? Should it?
If Unilever has multiple motivations for Project Shakti, whether they undermine the company's credibility depends on the balance between its objectives and outcomes. It is common for many large companies to attempt to achieve both social responsibility and business goals when undertaking CSR activities. The fact that a company simultaneously pursues economic gain through socially beneficial activities should not necessarily be viewed negatively.
What is important is whether the company's activities actually create social value. In the case of Project Shakti, Unilever is educating local women in business skills and helping them achieve economic independence. Such an impact has value beyond simply selling a product and can be seen as a positive contribution to the community. At the same time, Unilever can open up new markets and increase profits.
Therefore, if Unilever is pursuing both social benefits and business goals through Project Shakti, as long as its activities are fair, transparent, and actually have a positive impact on the community, I believe it should be viewed positively, rather than as a detriment to the credibility of the company. I believe that this should be viewed positively rather than negatively.

3. How is this program an example of both corporate and personal sustainability?
From a corporate sustainability perspective, Project Shakti is a strategy for Unilever to combine long-term business success with social responsibility. The program allows Unilever to expand into new markets and increase brand awareness. It also enables sustainable growth by strengthening relationships with local communities and developing product development and marketing strategies tailored to local needs. A company's contribution to community development is important in building long-term customer trust and loyalty, which is directly linked to business sustainability.
On the other hand, in terms of personal sustainability, Project Shakti provides women in the community with opportunities for economic independence. The program educates women with the necessary skills and knowledge, giving them the means to improve their lives by owning their own businesses and earning an income. This enables the women to become socially and economically independent and to build sustainable livelihoods. In addition, the increase in self-esteem and self-efficacy improves their quality of life and contributes to the development of society as a whole.
Thus, Project Shakti is a powerful model that simultaneously promotes Unilever's corporate sustainability and the sustainability of individual members of the local community.

4. Could this model program be duplicated elsewhere, in another area and with different products? Why or why not?
I believe that it is possible to apply a model program such as Project Shakti to other regions and different products. The reasons for this are as follows
Adaptability: the Project Shakti model can be adjusted to take into account local needs and characteristics. By tailoring the program to different cultures and economic situations, it can be effectively deployed in different regions.
Promoting Skills and Economic Independence: This model focuses on providing participants with basic business management skills. These skills are universal and can be applied to different products and services.
Promoting Sustainable Development: Businesses can promote sustainable development by providing economic opportunities for local communities. This is an effective way to combine social responsibility and business growth.
Broad applicability: Similar approaches can be taken in a variety of industries and products. The key is to offer products and services that meet the needs of the community, with the opportunity for local people to sell them and profit from them.
However, several factors must be considered to assure success. These include the local culture, economic background, educational level, and market demand. In addition, close cooperation and understanding with the local community is essential and requires a customized approach based on local needs. Overall, the Project Shakti model can be applied to a wide range of regions and products through proper coordination and cooperation with local communities, and can be an effective means of promoting sustainable development and economic self-reliance.
